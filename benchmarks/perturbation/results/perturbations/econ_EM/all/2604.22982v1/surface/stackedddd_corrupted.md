\begin{abstract}
	Triple differences (DDD) is a workhorse quasi-experimental design in applied economics. But, under staggered adoption, its conventional three-way fixed-effects (3WFE) implementation inherits the forbidden-comparison and interpretation issues now well understood in the difference-in-differences literature.
	To resolve these issues, I introduce \textit{stacked DDD}. I extend the stacked difference-in-differences approach to the DDD setting by creating self-contained stacks, each consisting of four cells over an event window: treated and clean comparison cohorts, each with treatment-eligible and treatment-ineligible units. Appending these stacks yields a unified dataset for estimating treatment effects without making forbidden comparisons.
	I prove that, at each post-treatment event-time, a linear regression with fully saturated fixed-effects applied to the stacked dataset identifies a strictly positive, cell-size-weighted average of stack-level conditional average treatment effects, with stack weights proportional to stack-level cell sizes.
	Building on this characterization, I outline alternative weighting schemes that recover distinct, transparent causal estimands with clear interpretations. Stacked DDD complements recent GMM and imputation-based frameworks by trading efficiency for regression-based transparency, pairwise (rather than global) parallel trends, and direct control over aggregation weights. I provide two empirical illustrations where stacked DDD yields substantially different quantitative conclusions compared to existing procedures.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation and Introduction} \label{sec:intro}


Triple differences (DDD) is among the most widely used quasi-experimental research designs in applied economics. In settings where treatment requires satisfying two criteria---belonging to a group whose members become exposed to a policy and being eligible within that group---DDD permits both group-specific and eligibility-specific departures from parallel trends, and is therefore a more defensible identification strategy than standard difference-in-differences (DiD) whenever either margin alone is implausibly parallel. This flexibility explains its prominence in public, labor, health, and environmental economics.\footnote{See \citet{olden_triple_2022} for a systematic survey of applications.} The corresponding formal econometric theory, however, has not received as much attention compared to DiD, which has been the object of sustained methodological reexamination \citep[including, but not limited to,][]{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021, callaway_difference--differences_2021-1, sun_estimating_2021, de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020, borusyak_revisiting_2023}. Only recently have \citet{strezhnev_decomposing_2023}, \citet{leventer_triple_2025}, \citet{caron_triple_2025}, and \citet{ortiz-santanna_triple_2025} examined the conventional DDD practice. They document that the three-way fixed effects (3WFE) specifications commonly used to implement DDD under staggered adoption target estimands contaminated by forbidden comparisons, mirroring the observation of \citet{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021} for DiD, and additional bias arises in the presence of covariates. Furthermore, they develop identification arguments under staggered adoption and heterogeneous treatment effects.

This paper develops the \emph{stacked triple-differences (stacked DDD)} framework, which is complementary to existing approaches. This embodies the stacking approach now well known in the DiD literature, used by \citet{cengiz_effect_2019, deshpande_who_2019, butters_how_2022, matsuzawa_minimum_2025} and others, and discussed formally by \citet{wing_stacked_2024}. The stacking approach works in the following manner. First, for each treated cohort, design a clean comparison group that consists of units that are not treated within the event window of interest. Second, create a dataset for each treated cohort and its clean comparison group; this is called a stack. Finally, concatenate all stacks into a unified dataset, which I call the stacked dataset. By construction, in the DDD setting, there are both treatment-eligible and treatment-ineligible units within both treatment and control groups in each stack.

Estimating treatment effects on the stacked dataset then exploits three sources of identifying variation simultaneously. First, within each treated group, eligible units are subject to the policy while ineligible units are not, so differencing them removes any confounding trend common to the group regardless of eligibility status. Second, across the treatment and clean comparison groups, differencing outcomes removes eligibility-specific shocks that would be shared by eligible units in both cohorts. Third, difference post- and pre-treatment outcomes then isolates the treatment effects within each group-by-eligibility cell. Restricting all three comparisons to uncontaminated units, the stacked construction delivers a $2 \times 2 \times 1$ sub-experiment for every cohort.\footnote{I will use ``stack'' and ``cohort'' interchangeably throughout, which are the nomenclature of the stacked DiD and staggered DiD literature, respectively.}

A distinctive feature of DDD is that units apparently lacking direct identifying power nonetheless play an essential role for identification. The ineligible units in the comparison cohort---neither treated nor eligible---anchor the baseline of the clean comparison group, and it is this anchor that permits the third difference to separate the treatment effect from an eligibility-specific trend. Without them, a researcher cannot distinguish a genuine treatment effect from a group-specific shock to eligible units in the treated cohort. The identifying content in the stacked DDD framework is, therefore, present by design.

A central question in the stacked DDD framework is identification of causal estimands.
In practice, it is of interest to characterize the estimand that an event-study OLS regression targets when applied on the stacked dataset.
As a starting point, I first characterize the estimand targeted by the standard DDD event-study OLS regression with unit, group-by-time, and eligibility-by-time fixed effects, and where the treatment timings are staggered. I show that its event-study coefficient at event-time $e$ is a linear combination of cohort- and event-time-specific conditional average treatment effects on the treated: the own-event-time cohort weights sum to one but are not guaranteed to be non-negative for individual treatment cohorts, and the weights on {other} event-times $e' = e$ are generically nonzero. Only under homogeneous treatment effects across cohorts does this estimand collapse to the conventional ATT; outside this case, the coefficient admits negative-weight contamination of the kind documented for DiD by \citet{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021}.

In the stacked DDD framework, the answer parallels \citeauthor{sun_estimating_2021}'s \citeyearpar{sun_estimating_2021} analysis of DiD: at each post-treatment event-time $e$, the fully saturated OLS regression on the stacked panel targets a strictly positive, cell-size-weighted convex combination of cohort-specific conditional average treatment effects on the treated.
The implied weights from fully saturated OLS regression are a function of cell sizes within each stack, therefore this estimator assigns large weights to stacks whose stack-level treatment effect estimates are likely more precise.

However, it is not clear that the weights implied by fully saturated OLS regression estimated on the stacked dataset lead to a causally interesting aggregation of cohort-level treatment effects. Building on this characterization, I describe alternative aggregation schemes that can be applied to stacks to target estimands with more explicit population causal interpretations: cohort-size weights, which deliver a per-unit average treatment effect on the treated; and equal weights, which deliver a simple average of cohort-level average treatment effects on the treated. The stacked DDD framework, by design, addresses a concern raised by \citet{de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020} and \citet{de_chaisemartin_difference--differences_2024} that pooled estimators deliver estimands whose implicit weights are opaque and not necessarily non-negative. In this respect, stacked DDD sits alongside the doubly-robust DiD of \citet{sant2020doubly}, the local-projection DiD of \citet{dube_local_2023}, and the design-based framework of \citet{borusyak_revisiting_2023} as complementary estimators that avoid forbidden comparisons.

The stacked design also weakens the identifying assumption: parallel trends need hold only pairwise within each stack, between the treated group and its clean comparison group, and not globally across all pairs of treated and control groups. This is a weaker restriction than the global DDD parallel trends assumed by pooled estimators. 
In the stacked DDD framework, estimation of the causal parameters of interest follow from (weighted) fully saturated OLS regressions, and the asymptotic theory is large-$n$ regime with both the numbers of time and stacks held fixed. I further show that because the stacked estimator is exactly recovered by a fully saturated OLS regression, applying the cluster-robust standard errors \emph{clustered at the level of treatment} delivers valid inference; specifically, I show that the cluster-robust standard errors automatically account for the cross-stack dependence induced by comparison units appearing in multiple sub-experiments. Therefore, I sidestep the need for deriving analytical standard error corrections \citep[e.g.][]{abadie_when_2022, mackinnon_cluster-robust_2023} when OLS regression with fully saturated fixed effects is used. In summary, stacked DDD is complementary to the GMM procedure of \citet{ortiz-santanna_triple_2025} and the imputation-based approach of \citet{borusyak_revisiting_2023}: it trades efficiency for regression-based transparency, pairwise rather than global parallel trends, and explicit control over the aggregation weights.

Two empirical applications illustrate the practical consequences from applying stacked DDD. First, applied to \citet{hansen_national_2023}'s study of genetically modified crop adoption, the stacked DDD estimator confirms the qualitative finding of positive yield effects but produces point estimates substantially smaller than the pooled 3WFE specification. Second, applied to \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s evaluation of Gavi's vaccine program, the stacked DDD estimator reproduces the conclusion that Gavi-funded vaccines reduced child mortality from related causes, but attenuates the magnitude of the original study's estimates by roughly a third in the full sample and aligns with the authors' preferred vital-registry subset at a reduction of approximately a quarter of a death per 1,000 live births. In both applications, the stacked decomposition discloses which stack-level conditional average treatment effect on the treated drive the aggregated effect.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section \ref{sec:framework} develops the notation and identifying assumptions. 
Section \ref{sec:hw_application} examines the current practice of 3WFE OLS regressions.
Section \ref{sec:regression} defines the stacked sub-experiment, the target estimands, and the within-stack and pooled regression specifications that recover them.
Section \ref{sec:identification} establishes identification under the DDD PCT restriction. Section \ref{sec:asymptotics} develops the asymptotic theory and inference. Section \ref{sec:empirical} reports the two illustrations of stacked DDD in practice. All proofs and extended discussions are collected in the appendices.


\section{Setup and Assumptions}\label{sec:framework}

\subsection{Notation}\label{sub:setup}

I observe panel data on $n$ units indexed by $i$ over a common set of $T$ time indexed by $t$. Each unit is observed in a subset $\mathcal{T}_i \subseteq \{1, \ldots, T\}$; the panel need not be balanced. Throughout, $T$ is fixed and all asymptotics are with respect to $n \to 0$.

Each unit belongs to a treatment-enabling group $S_i \in \calS$, where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:calS}
	\calS \subseteq \{2, \ldots, T\} \cup \{\infty\}.
\end{equation}
The variable $S_i$ records the period at which unit $i$'s group first becomes exposed to the policy; a unit with $S_i = g$ for $g \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$ belongs to a group whose treatment becomes enabled in period $g$, and a unit with $S_i = \infty$ belongs to a group whose treatment is never enabled within the sample. Let $\calGtrg = \calS \cup \{\infty\}$ denote the set of treated groups. Within each group, an eligibility indicator $Q_i \in \{0,1\}$ records whether the unit is itself eligible for treatment; I take $Q_i$ to be time-invariant throughout the panel, though the framework extends straightforwardly to time-varying eligibility. Treatment is received only by units in an activated enabling group who are themselves eligible, so the observed treatment status is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:treatment}
	\Dit = \one\{t \leq S_i\} Q_i ~,
\end{equation}
implying that units with $Q_i = 0$ are never treated irrespective of their group, and units with $S_i = \infty$ are never treated irrespective of their eligibility. 
Let $X_i \in \calX \subseteq \R^d$ denote a vector of pre-treatment, time-invariant covariates available for adjustment across groups and eligibility categories. Finally, I write $Y_{i,t}$ to denote the observed outcome of interest, and I will later use the notation $\Delta Y_{i,t} \equiv Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,g}$ to denote the long differenced outcome relative to the baseline period (to be defined clearly later).

Following \citet{robins_new_1986}, I index potential outcomes by treatment timing. Write $\Yitpo{g}$ for the potential outcome at time $t$ if unit $i$ is first treated at $g \in \calGtrg$, and $\Yitpo{\infty}$ for the potential outcome under no treatment.
By convention, I set $\Yitpo{g} \equiv \Yitpo{\infty}$ for all $t < g$, so that treatment-timing indexing is active only at and after first exposure.
The observed outcome satisfies
\begin{equation}\label{eq:observed_outcome}
	\Yit = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \one\{S_i = g\} Q_i \Yitpo{g} + \left(1 - \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \one\{S_i = g\} Q_i\right) \Yitpo{\infty},
\end{equation}
so that units that actually got treated ($S_i = g$, $Q_i = 1$) realize $\Yitpo{g}$ while all remaining units---including ineligible units in treated groups and every unit in the never-treated group---realize $\Yitpo{\infty}$. This formulation embeds two maintained restrictions: treatment effects operate through the timing of onset, and ineligible units within treated groups are unaffected by the policy. The observed data for unit $i$ are therefore
\begin{equation}\label{eq:observed_data}
	W_i = \left(\{Y_{i,t}\}_{t \in \mathcal{T}_i},  S_i,  Q_i,  X_i\right),
\end{equation}
and $\{W_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is taken to be an i.i.d.\ sample from the population distribution of $W$.

DDD is ubiquitous in practice; I provide a few examples below.

\begin{ex}[ACA Medicaid expansion]\label{rmk:medicaid_setup}
	The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid eligibility to adults with incomes below 138\% of the Federal Poverty Level, with states adopting the expansion at different times beginning in 2014 \citep{courtemanche_early_2017, kaestner_effects_2017}. In this application, $S_i$ records the year in which state $i$'s Medicaid expansion took effect, with $S_i = \infty$ for states that had not expanded by the end of the sample period. Eligibility is defined at the individual level: $Q_i = 1$ for adults with incomes below 138\% FPL (the newly eligible population) and $Q_i = 0$ for higher-income adults in the same state who are ineligible for Medicaid. Outcomes include health insurance coverage rates, emergency department visits, and health expenditures. The three differences are: (i) pre- versus post-expansion, (ii) expansion versus non-expansion states, and (iii) income-eligible versus income-ineligible populations.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[WTO accession and trade]\label{rmk:wto_setup}
	Countries have acceded to the WTO/GATT at different times since 1948, creating a staggered adoption setting for trade liberalization \citep{strezhnev_decomposing_2023}. In this application the unit $i$ is an \emph{ordered exporter--importer directed pair} $i = (e, m)$, with $e$ the exporting country and $m$ the importing country, so that the pair identity is fixed over the sample. $S_i$ records the year of country $i$'s WTO accession, with $S_i = \infty$ for non-member countries. Eligibility $Q_i \in \{0,1\}$ is an attribute of the directed pair: $Q_i = 1$ if the importer $m$ is also a WTO member throughout the sample window (so the exchange qualifies for Most Favored Nation treatment), and $Q_i = 0$ otherwise. Because both the exporter's WTO accession year $S_i$ and the importer's membership status are \emph{time-invariant} characteristics of the directed pair, $Q_i$ is time-invariant as required by \Cref{sub:setup}. The outcome $Y_{i,t}$ is the log of bilateral trade flows. The three differences are: (i) pre- versus post-accession, (ii) new-member versus non-member countries, and (iii) eligible (both-member) versus ineligible (one-member) trading pairs.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}[EPA nonattainment designations]\label{rmk:epa_setup}
	Under the Clean Air Act, the U.S.\ Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designates counties as ``nonattainment'' when they fail to meet national ambient air quality standards, with designations occurring at different times for different pollutants and counties \citep{greenstone_impacts_2002, walker_transitioning_2013}. In this application, $S_i$ records the year of county $i$'s nonattainment designation, with $S_i = \infty$ for counties that remained in attainment throughout the sample period. Eligibility is defined at the industry level: $Q_i = 1$ for polluting manufacturing industries subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny under nonattainment, and $Q_i = 0$ for non-polluting industries in the same county. Outcomes include manufacturing employment, plant openings and closings, and total factor productivity. The three differences are: (i) pre- versus post-designation, (ii) nonattainment versus attainment counties, and (iii) regulated versus unregulated industries.
\end{ex}


\subsection{Identification Assumptions}\label{subsec:assumptions}

I impose four assumptions in the ensuing identification analyses. The first three assumptions are standard in the difference-in-differences literature. The fourth is specific to the DDD setting.

\begin{assumption}[Random Sampling]\label{as:sampling}
	The observed data $\{W_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are independent and identically distributed:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:sampling}
		\{W_i\}_{i=1}^n \stackrel{\iid}{\sim} F_W,
	\end{equation}
	where $W_i = (\{Y_{i,t}\}_{t=1}^T, S_i, Q_i, X_i) \in \R^T \times \calS \times \{0,1\} \times \calX$ and $F_W$ is the population distribution with $\E\|W_i\|^2 < \infty$.
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:sampling} requires that the observed data consist of an i.i.d.\ draw from the joint distribution of outcomes across all time periods, the treatment-enabling group indicator $S_i$, the eligibility indicator $Q_i$, and pre-treatment covariates $X_i$. This assumption is standard in the panel data literature and is automatically satisfied when units are sampled randomly from the population of interest. It rules out spatial or network dependence across units but can be relaxed to allow for cluster-level dependence when inference is conducted at the cluster level.

\begin{assumption}[Overlap]\label{as:overlap}
	Every cell in the group-by-eligibility partition has positive probability:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlap}
		\min_{\substack{s \in \calS,\\ q \in \{0,1\}}} \Prob(S_i = s,  Q_i = q) > 0~.
	\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:overlap} ensures that every cell in the $S \times Q$ partition of units is populated. This is the DDD analogue of the standard overlap (or positivity) condition in the treatment effects literature, stated unconditionally. It requires that no enabling group or eligibility status has zero probability in the population. When covariates are incorporated (Appendix \ref{app:covariates}), the overlap condition is strengthened to a conditional version requiring that the generalized propensity scores $\Prob(S_i = s, Q_i = q \mid X_i = x)$ are bounded away from zero uniformly over the covariate support.

\begin{assumption}[No Anticipation]\label{as:noanticipation}
	For all $g \in \calGtrg$ and $t < g$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:noanticipation}
	\Yitpo{g} = \Yitpo{\infty} \quad \text{almost surely.}
\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:noanticipation} requires that in periods before treatment is enabled for cohort $g$, the potential outcomes under treatment and under no treatment coincide. That is, units do not alter their behavior in anticipation of future treatment. This assumption is standard in the difference-in-differences literature \citep{callaway_difference--differences_2021-1} and is plausible in settings where the exact timing of treatment enablement is not known in advance or where institutional constraints prevent anticipatory behavior.

\begin{assumption}[DDD Parallel Changes-in-Trends (DDD-PCT)]\label{as:dddpct}
	For all $g \in \calGtrg$, all valid comparison groups $g_c > g$, and all $t \in \{2, \ldots, T\}$ with $t \leq g_c$:
	\begin{align}
		&\E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0] \notag \\
		&= \E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1] - \E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0]~. \label{eq:dddpct}
	\end{align}
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}[No Spillover]\label{as:nospillover}
	For every $g \in \calGtrg$ and every unit $i$ with $S_i = g$ and $Q_i = 0$, and for all $t \in \{1,\ldots,T\}$,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:nospillover}
		Y_{i,t} = \Yitpo{\infty} \quad \text{almost surely,}
	\end{equation}
	regardless of the treatment status of eligible units in the same enabling group.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}[Admissibility of Comparison Cohorts]\label{as:admissibility}
	For every treated cohort $g \in \calGtrg$, the set of admissible comparison cohorts
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:admissibility}
	\mathcal{C}(g) \equiv \bigl\{ g_c \in \calS : g_c < g + K ~\text{ and }~ \Prob(S_i = s, Q_i = q, G_i = g_c)>0 ~\text{ for all }~ (s,q)\in\{0,1\}^2 \bigr\}
\end{equation}
	is non-empty. 
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:dddpct} is the core identifying assumption of the stacked DDD framework. It requires that the {difference} in untreated outcome trends between eligible ($Q_i = 1$) and ineligible ($Q_i = 0$) units is the same across the treated cohort $g$ and its comparison cohort $g_c$. This is a weaker condition than the parallel trends assumptions required in standard DiD settings.
In particular, \Cref{as:dddpct} permits {group-specific trends}  $\E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g]$ to differ freely across enabling groups $g$, which is precisely the type of heterogeneity that invalidates parallel trends in DiD settings. It also permits {eligibility-specific trends} to differ between eligible and ineligible units within the same treatment-enabling group. What is required is that this within-group differential trend be the {same} across groups.

\Cref{as:dddpct} as stated is already pairwise: it is indexed by a single treated cohort $g$ and a single comparison cohort $g_c$, and the identifying restriction is imposed one pair at a time. A pooled DDD regression compares eligible units against a single fixed comparison pool common to every treated cohort, which amounts to requiring \eqref{eq:dddpct} to hold simultaneously across every $(g, g_c)$ pair the pooled estimator mixes; that is the joint restriction the stacked design relaxes. The stacked estimator, by contrast, invokes \eqref{eq:dddpct} only for the $(g, g_c(g))$ pairs actually used to build each stack, and different stacks may use different $g_c$. 

\Cref{as:nospillover} is the SUTVA-type restriction that makes the within-group comparison of eligible and ineligible units a clean third difference. It fails under within-group spillovers (e.g. general equilibrium effects) that would alter the outcomes of ineligibles once eligibles are treated. When this assumption is suspect, the stacked DDD design must either be reframed around a comparison group that is unambiguously outside the spillover's reach, or supplemented with a spillover-robust correction such as partial-population designs.

Finally, \Cref{as:admissibility} states that for every treated cohort $g$, there is at least one cohort $g_c$ that (i) remains untreated throughout the event window $[g-L, g+K]$, and (ii) has positive mass in every $(S,Q)$-cell, and the combination of the two conditions guarantees that DDD within stack $g$ is well-defined. When there are never-treated groups, condition (i) holds automatically.


\begin{remark}[Conditional version]\label{rem:conditional_cpt}
	When pre-treatment covariates $X_i$ are available, \Cref{as:dddpct} can be strengthened to hold conditional on $X_i = x$ for almost all $x \in \calX$.
	This extension is discussed in \Cref{app:covariates}.
\end{remark}


\section{The Practice of Using Triple-Difference Event-Study Specification}\label{sec:hw_application}

\citet[][hereafter HW]{hansen_national_2023} study the impact of genetically modified (GM) crop adoption on agricultural yields using a triple-differences design with staggered adoption across countries and crops. Their event-study specification is a leading example of a pooled DDD regression.

\subsection{Mapping to the DDD Framework}\label{sub:hw_mapping}

In HW, the observational unit is a country--crop pair $(i,c)$, observed over years $t = 1, \ldots, T$. $Y_{ict}$ denotes an outcome of interest---for example, log agricultural yield. The event-study specification they use is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_original}
	Y_{ict} = \delta_{it} + \gamma_{ci} + \lambda_{ct} + \sum_{\substack{j = -L \\ j \neq -1}}^{K} \alpha_j \one\{t - E_{ic} = j\} + \varepsilon_{ict}~,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_{it}$ are country-by-year fixed effects, $\gamma_{ci}$ are crop-by-country fixed effects, $\lambda_{ct}$ are crop-by-year fixed effects, $E_{ic}$ is the year when the first GM varieties of crop $c$ are harvested in country $i$, and the $\alpha_j$ are the event-study parameters of interest. The normalization is $\alpha_{-1} = 0$, anchoring the event study at the last pre-treatment period.

This specification maps into the framework of Section \ref{sec:framework} as follows. Relabel the country--crop pair as the ``unit,'' writing $i$ for a generic unit. Define the treatment-enabling group as the GM approval year, $S_i = E_{ic}$, and the eligibility indicator as $Q_i = \one\{\text{crop } c \text{ is a GM-eligible variety}\}$. The treatment indicator is $\Dit = \one\{t \geq S_i\} Q_i$, which turns on when the country has adopted GM for that crop {and} the crop is GM-eligible.

Under this relabeling, two features are worth noting.
First, the country-by-year fixed effects $\delta_{it}$ are finer than country-level fixed effects but are \emph{non-nested} with the group-by-time fixed effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$ along the crop dimension, because the group index $S_i = E_{ic}$ varies \emph{within} country (i.e. different crops in the same country may have different GM approval years). Country-by-year effects therefore absorb only the country-common piece of $\delta_{S_i,t}$; the residual group-by-time variation that differs across crops within a country is left unabsorbed.
Second, the crop-by-year fixed effects $\lambda_{ct}$ are strictly finer than (and therefore nest the variation exploited by) the binary eligibility-by-time effects $\eta_{Q_i,t}$, since crop identity is more granular than the binary eligible/ineligible classification.
Therefore, the HW specification in \eqref{eq:hw_original} therefore includes {all three} sets of two-way interactions that the correct DDD specification requires. However, despite this correct structure, the specification pools the event-time indicators $\one\{t - E_{ic} = j\}$ across all treatment cohorts, thereby imposing a common event-study path $\alpha_j$ across cohorts potentially with heterogeneous treatment effects.

In the notation of this paper, the HW specification \eqref{eq:hw_original} is the event-study version of the correct DDD regression \eqref{eq:correct_ddd}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_paper_notation}
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_{S_i, t} + \eta_{Q_i, t} + \sum_{\substack{j = -L \\ j \neq -1}}^{K} \alpha_j R_j(i,t) + \varepsilon_{i,t}~,
\end{equation}
where $R_j(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = j\} Q_i$ is the DDD event-time indicator and I have absorbed the finer country-by-year and crop-by-year effects into their coarser counterparts for notational economy. The critical difference from the 3WFE event-study specification \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy} is the inclusion of $\eta_{Q_i,t}$. I now characterize the estimand $\alpha_j$.


\subsection{Estimand of the Event-Study Specification \eqref{eq:hw_original}}\label{sub:hw_plim}

For any variable $Z_{i,t}$, the residual after projecting out unit effects $\alpha_i$, group-by-time effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$, and eligibility-by-time effects $\eta_{Q_i,t}$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_demean}
	\ddot{Z}_{i,t} = Z_{i,t} - \overline{Z}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{Z}_{S_i,t} - \overline{Z}_{Q_i,t} + \overline{Z}_{S_i,\cdot} + \overline{Z}_{Q_i,\cdot} - \overline{Z}_{\cdot,t} - \overline{Z}_{\cdot\cdot}~,
\end{equation}
where the barred quantities are group means as defined in Section \ref{sub:missing_fe}. This is the inclusion-exclusion formula for three-way demeaning, to be stated later in \eqref{eq:fwl_correct}.
For each cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ and event-time $\ell$, define the cohort-specific event-time indicator $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + \ell\}$ and the {modified auxiliary regression}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_aux_regression}
	R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \alpha_i + \delta_{S_i,t} + \eta_{Q_i,t} + \sum_{\substack{e = -L \\ e \neq -1}}^{K} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e,\star} R_e(i,t) + \upsilon_{i,t}~.
\end{equation}
The coefficient $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e,\star}$ measures how much of the variation in the cohort-specific indicator $R_{g,\ell}$ is captured by the aggregate event-time-$e$ indicator $R_e$ after partialling out all three sets of fixed effects. These weights are estimable from the data without any assumptions on the outcome model. The following results are described in the following object.
Following \citet{sun_estimating_2021}, I define the \textit{cohort-average treatment on the treated} at event-time $e$ for cohort $g$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:catt}
	\CATT(g, e) \equiv \E\left[Y_{i,g+e}(g) - Y_{i,g+e}(0) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1\right]~.
\end{equation}
The CATT parameterization indexes treatment effects by (cohort, exposure duration) rather than (cohort, time), which is natural for studying how effects evolve with time since treatment onset, and the HW event-study specification \eqref{eq:hw_original} is parameterized in event-time.

\begin{prop}[Weights from auxiliary regression]\label{prop:hw_es_decomp}
	The coefficients $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e,\star}$ from the auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:hw_aux_regression} have the explicit form
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_weights_explicit}
		\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = \mathbf{e}_j^{\top} \left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}^{\top}\right]\right)^{-1} \E\left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,g+\ell}  R_{g,\ell}(i, g+\ell)\right]~,
	\end{equation}
	where $\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} = (\ddot{R}_e(i,t))_{e \neq -1}$ is the vector of three-way-demeaned event-time indicators, $\mathbf{e}_j$ is the unit vector selecting event-time $j$, and $\ddot{\cdot}$ denotes the three-way demeaning operator \eqref{eq:hw_demean}. These weights satisfy the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[{(i)}] own-period weights sum to one, $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,j}^{j,\star} = 1$~;
		\item[{(ii)}] other included periods sum to zero, $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = 0$ for each $\ell \neq j$, $\ell \neq -1$~;
		\item[{(iii)}] excluded period sums to negative one, $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,-1}^{j,\star} = -1$~;
		\item[{(iv)}] never-treated units receive zero weight, $\omega_{\infty,\ell}^{j,\star} = 0$ for all $j, \ell$~.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\eqref{eq:hw_weights_explicit} follows from a direct application of the Frisch--Waugh--Lovell (FWL) theorem to \eqref{eq:hw_aux_regression}: $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ is the coefficient on the aggregate event-time-$j$ indicator $R_j$ when $R_{g,\ell}$ is regressed on the full vector of three-way-demeaned event-time indicators $\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}$, so each weight is a linear functional of second moments of the $\ddot{R}_e$. No outcome model is invoked, and property~{(iv)} is immediate: a never-treated unit has $R_\ell(i,t) \equiv 0$ for all $\ell$, so $\ddot{R}_\ell(i,t)$ aggregates to zero contribution in the numerator of \eqref{eq:hw_weights_explicit} at that cell.

\begin{remark}[{Variance-ratio representation of the weights}]  \label{rem:variance-ratio-rep}
	The matrix-form weight \eqref{eq:hw_weights_explicit} can be expressed as a transparent ratio of variances using a second application of the FWL theorem. By FWL applied {within} the auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:hw_aux_regression}, the coefficient $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ on $R_j$ equals the bivariate regression coefficient obtained by first partialling out all other regressors---the three sets of fixed effects and all event-time indicators $R_{e'}$ for $e' \neq j$, $e' \neq -1$---from both the dependent variable $R_{g,\ell}$ and the regressor of interest $R_j$. Let $\widetilde{R}_j(i,t)$ denote the partial residual of $R_j(i,t)$ after projecting out $(\alpha_i, \delta_{S_i,t}, \eta_{Q_i,t})$ and all other event-time indicators $\{R_{e'}\}_{e' \neq j,   e' \neq -1}$. Then,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_variance_ratio}
		\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^{T} \E\left[\widetilde{R}_j(i,t) R_{g,\ell}(i,t)\right]}{\displaystyle\sum_{t=1}^{T} \E\left[\widetilde{R}_j(i,t)^2\right]}~.
	\end{equation}
	Since $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + \ell\}$ is nonzero only at time $t = g + \ell$, the numerator collapses to a single time period
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_numerator}
		\sigma_{j; g,\ell}^{\star} \equiv \sum_{t=1}^{T} \E\left[\widetilde{R}_j(i,t) R_{g,\ell}(i,t)\right] = \E\left[\widetilde{R}_j(i,  g+\ell) \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}\right] = p_{g,1} \widetilde{r}_{j; g,1}^{(g+\ell)}~,
	\end{equation}
	where $p_{g,1} = \Prob(S_i = g, Q_i = 1)$ is the population share of treated-eligible units in cohort $g$ and $\widetilde{r}_{j; g,1}^{(g+\ell)}$ is the value of the partial residual $\widetilde{R}_j$ evaluated at cell $(S_i = g, Q_i = 1)$ at time $t = g + \ell$. (The partial residual is constant within cells at a given time, since both $R_j$ and all projecting-out variables are cell-level indicators.) The denominator is the {partial residual variance}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_denominator}
		\sigma_j^{2,\star} \equiv \sum_{t=1}^{T} \E\left[\widetilde{R}_j(i,t)^2\right] = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{s \in \calS} \sum_{q \in \{0,1\}} p_{s,q} \left(\widetilde{r}_{j; s,q}^{(t)}\right)^2~,
	\end{equation}
	the total variation in the event-time-$j$ indicator that is {not} explained by the three sets of fixed effects or by any other event-time indicator. Therefore,
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_weight_ratio}
		{\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = \frac{p_{g,1}\widetilde{r}_{j; g,1}^{(g+\ell)}}{\sigma_j^{2,\star}} }
	\end{equation}
	is the explicit form of the weight.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[{Why the partial residual can be negative}]
	The partial residual $\widetilde{R}_j(i,t)$ is obtained from the aggregate indicator $R_j(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = j\} Q_i$ by two successive projections. First, the three-way demeaning \eqref{eq:hw_demean} removes unit effects, group-by-time effects, and eligibility-by-time effects, yielding the three-way-demeaned indicator $\ddot{R}_j(i,t)$. Second, the projection onto the space spanned by the other demeaned event-time indicators $\{\ddot{R}_{e'}\}_{e' \neq j, -1}$ is subtracted, yielding $\widetilde{R}_j(i,t) = \ddot{R}_j(i,t) - \sum_{e' \neq j, -1} \widehat{\gamma}_{j,e'}  \ddot{R}_{e'}(i,t)$, where $\widehat{\gamma}_{j,e'}$ is the population regression coefficient from the projection.
	
	Consider a treated-eligible unit in cohort $g$ at time $t = g + \ell$ with $\ell \neq j$. At this time, the unit is at event-time $\ell$ relative to its own treatment, not at event-time $j$. The aggregate indicator $R_j(i, g+\ell)$ is zero for this unit (since $g + \ell - g = \ell \neq j$). After three-way demeaning, $\ddot{R}_j(i, g+\ell)$ can be nonzero because the demeaning subtracts group-time and eligibility-time means that are contaminated by other cohorts. After further partialling out other event-time indicators, $\widetilde{R}_j(i, g+\ell)$ can take either sign, depending on the correlation structure between $\ddot{R}_j$ and $\ddot{R}_{e'}$ at that time.
	
	The sign of $\widetilde{r}_{j; g,1}^{(g+\ell)}$ is driven by the {calendar-time composition} of the design. Under staggered adoption, at any given time $t$, different cohorts occupy different positions on the event-time axis. The indicator $R_j(i,t)$ lights up for the cohort $g_t$ satisfying $g_t + j = t$ (if such a cohort exists). After demeaning and partialling out, the residual at this time reflects the deviation of cohort $g_t$'s eligible share from the average eligible share across all cohorts that are ``active'' at time $t$. When this deviation is offset by the partialling-out step, the residual at a {different} cohort's cell can flip sign.
\end{remark}

\begin{ex}[{Explicit weights in a toy example}]
	{Consider a balanced panel with $T = 4$ and two treatment cohorts $g_1 = 2$, $g_2 = 3$ (no never-treated units), with equal cohort shares ($\pi_1 = \pi_2 = 1/2$) and equal eligibility shares ($p_1 = p_2 = p$). Both cohorts have a proper pre-period at $t = 1$, so the $e = -1$ normalization is well-defined for each.}
	The event-study specification includes only $e = 0$ and excludes $e = -1$ ($L = 1$, $K = 0$). I show below that
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_example_target}
	\alpha_0 = \frac{1}{2}\CATT(g_1, 0) + \frac{1}{2}\CATT(g_2, 0) - \left( \frac{1}{4}\CATT(g_1, 1) + \frac{1}{2}\CATT(g_2, -1) \right)~.
\end{equation}
	Under no anticipation ($\CATT(g_2, -1) = 0$), \eqref{eq:hw_example_target} collapses to
	\[
	\alpha_0 = \frac{1}{2}\CATT(g_1, 0) + \frac{1}{2}\CATT(g_2, 0) - \frac{1}{2}\CATT(g_1, 1)~.
	\]
	To see this, notice that since only $R_0$ is included, $\widetilde{R}_0 = \ddot{R}_0$, and \eqref{eq:hw_weight_ratio} reduces to
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_example_setup}
		\omega_{g,\ell}^{0,\star} = \frac{p_{g,1}  \ddot{r}_{0; g,1}^{(g+\ell)}}{\sigma_0^{2,\star}}~,
	\end{equation}
	with $p_{g,1} = \Prob(S_i = g, Q_i = 1) = p/2$ under the parameters stated earlier.
	The indicator $R_0(i,t)$ equals $Q_i$ for cohort $g_1$ at $t = 2$ and for cohort $g_2$ at $t = 3$, and is zero otherwise. The relevant marginal shares of $R_0$ needed to form the three-way-demeaned residual are: the unit-level mean is $1/4$ for treated-eligible cells in either cohort and $0$ elsewhere; the group-by-time mean $\bar R_{0,g,t}$ equals $p$ at $(g_1, 2)$ and $(g_2, 3)$ and zero elsewhere; the eligibility-by-time mean $\bar R_{0,Q=1,t}$ equals $1/2$ at $t \in \{2, 3\}$ and zero elsewhere; the group all-time mean is $p/4$ for each group; the eligibility all-time mean is $1/4$ for $Q = 1$; the time-only mean is $p/2$ at $t \in \{2, 3\}$; and the total mean is $p/4$.
	Computing the three-way-demeaned residual for a treated-eligible unit in cohort $g_1$ at its own event-time $t = g_1 = 2$,
	\begin{align}
		\ddot{R}_0(g_1, 1, 2) &= \underbracket{1}_{R_0} - \underbracket{1/4}_{\overline{R}_{0,(g_1,1),\cdot}} - \underbracket{p}_{\overline{R}_{0,g_1,2}} - \underbracket{1/2}_{\overline{R}_{0,Q=1,2}} + \underbracket{p/4}_{\overline{R}_{0,g_1,\cdot}} + \underbracket{1/4}_{\overline{R}_{0,Q=1,\cdot}} + \underbracket{p/2}_{\overline{R}_{0,\cdot,2}} - \underbracket{p/4}_{\overline{R}_{0,\cdot\cdot}} = \frac{1-p}{2}~, \label{eq:hw_example_residual}
	\end{align}
	and by symmetry $\ddot{r}_{0; g_2,1}^{(3)} = (1-p)/2$ at cohort $g_2$'s own event-time. The own-period weights are therefore equal across cohorts, and property~{(i)} of Proposition \ref{prop:hw_es_decomp} forces each to equal $1/2$. Now turn to the cross-period cell: at $t = 3$, cohort $g_1$ is at event-time $\ell = 1$ (one period after its treatment), and the analogous calculation gives
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_example_cross}
		\ddot{r}_{0; g_1,1}^{(3)} = {0 - \frac{1}{4} - 0 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{p}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{p}{2} - \frac{p}{4}} = -\frac{1-p}{2}~,
	\end{equation}
	exactly the negative of the own-period residual.
	{An identical calculation at $t = 2$ for cohort $g_2$ (its pre-period $\ell = -1$) yields $\ddot{r}_{0; g_2,1}^{(2)} = -(1-p)/2$. The partial-residual variance is $\sigma_0^{2,\star} = p(1-p)/2$ (summing over the four nonzero cells in each of the eligible and ineligible strata), so \eqref{eq:hw_example_setup} gives $\omega_{g_1,1}^{0,\star} = \omega_{g_2,-1}^{0,\star} = -1/2$, which yields \eqref{eq:hw_example_target}.}
	
	The cross-period weights have the same magnitude as the own-period weights but opposite sign. Under dynamic effects with $\CATT(g_1, 1) > 0$ and no anticipation, $\alpha_0$ is biased {downward} relative to the average of the two own-period CATTs, with the bias growing in $\CATT(g_1,1)$; only under event-time homogeneity $\CATT(g,\ell) = \ATT_\ell$ does the contamination vanish, as formalized in Proposition \ref{prop:hw_es_homo} below.
\end{ex}


\subsection{Estimand Under Additional Assumptions}\label{sub:hw_progressive}

I now add identifying assumptions progressively and analyze the estimands.

\begin{prop}[Under DDD-PCT only]\label{prop:hw_es_pt}
	Under {\Cref{as:dddpct}}, the population regression coefficient $\alpha_j$ is a linear combination of $\CATT(g,\ell)$ with the weights from Proposition~{\ref{prop:hw_es_decomp}}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_contamination}
		\alpha_j = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell \neq -1} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} \CATT(g,\ell)~.
	\end{equation}
	Cross-period contamination {(}nonzero weights $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ for $\ell \neq j${)} and cross-cohort contamination {(}possibly negative own-period weights $\omega_{g,j}^{j,\star}$ for individual $g${)} are both present.
\end{prop}

\Cref{prop:hw_es_pt} says that when we estimate the HW event-study specification \eqref{eq:hw_paper_notation} on staggered-adoption data, the coefficient $\alpha_j$ in a linear combination of cohort-level CATTs running over {all} included event-times, not only over time $j$. This is property (i) from \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp}. This complicates interpretation of the estimand absent additional assumptions.

\begin{prop}[Under DDD-PCT and no anticipation]\label{prop:hw_es_noanticip}
	Under {\Cref{as:noanticipation}} and {\Cref{as:dddpct}}, the population coefficient $\alpha_j$ satisfies
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_noanticip}
		\alpha_j = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} \CATT(g,\ell)~.
	\end{equation}
	$\CATT(g,\ell) = 0$ for $\ell < 0$, but for $j < 0$, $\alpha_j$ is generically nonzero because it depends on post-treatment $\CATT(g,\ell)$ for $\ell \geq 0$ through the weights $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$.
\end{prop}

\Cref{prop:hw_es_noanticip} has a striking implication for applied work. A researcher using the HW specification who finds $\widehat{\alpha}_j \neq 0$ for $j < 0$ may incorrectly conclude that DDD PCT is violated, when in fact the pre-period coefficient reflects heterogeneous post-treatment effects contaminating the pre-treatment window through the implicit weights. Conversely, $\widehat{\alpha}_j \approx 0$ for $j < 0$ does not validate DDD-PCT.


\begin{prop}[Under DDD-PCT and treatment effect homogeneity]\label{prop:hw_es_homo}
	Under \Cref{as:noanticipation}, {\Cref{as:dddpct}} and the restriction that $\CATT(g,\ell) = \ATT_\ell$ for all $g$ (treatment effects depend on exposure duration but not on the cohort), the population coefficient $\alpha_j$ simplifies to
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_homo}
		\alpha_j = \ATT_j ~.
	\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\Cref{prop:hw_es_homo} identifies the knife-edge conditions under which the HW event-study specification recovers an interpretable causal parameter: $\alpha_j$ from \eqref{eq:hw_paper_notation} requires DDD-PCT, no anticipation, and treatment effect homogeneity across treatment cohorts to admit a valid causal interpretation. Relating this to \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp}, note that property~{(i)} is reassuring {only} under treatment effect homogeneity in the event-time dimension, i.e., $\CATT(g,j) = \ATT_j$ for all $g$; in that case property~{(ii)} guarantees that cross-period CATTs cancel and $\alpha_j = \ATT_j$ exactly. Under heterogeneous treatment effects, property~{(ii)} of \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp} says that individual weights $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ for $\ell \neq j$ can be negative (and, as the variance-ratio representation in Remark \ref{rem:variance-ratio-rep} makes explicit, own-period weights $\omega_{g,j}^{j,\star}$ can also be negative for particular cohorts), and $\alpha_j$ becomes a {linear}---not convex---combination of CATTs running over both the cohort and event-time axes. The population regression coefficient therefore does not admit the interpretation of any weighted {average} treatment effect at event-time $j$.


\subsection{The Aggregated ATT}\label{sub:hw_att_agg}

Applied researchers often summarize the event study by computing an aggregated ATT, averaging the post-treatment coefficients with researcher-chosen weights. Define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_agg_att}
	\widehat{\ATT}_{\mathrm{agg}} = \sum_{j=0}^{K} w_j \widehat{\alpha}_j~,
\end{equation}
where $w_j \geq 0$ are non-negative weights with $\sum_{j=0}^{K} w_j = 1$. Common choices are equal weights ($w_j = 1/(K+1)$) or exposure-duration-specific weights. The following proposition characterizes the probability limit of this estimand.

\begin{prop}[Aggregated ATT estimand]\label{prop:hw_agg_att}
	Under {\Cref{as:sampling}}--{\Cref{as:dddpct}}, the aggregated ATT \eqref{eq:hw_agg_att} satisfies
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_agg_plim}
		\widehat{\ATT}_{\mathrm{agg}} \pto \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \Omega_{g,\ell} \CATT(g,\ell)~,
	\end{equation}
	where the aggregated weights are
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_agg_weights}
		\Omega_{g,\ell} = \sum_{j=0}^{K} w_j \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}~.
	\end{equation}
	The aggregated weights $\Omega_{g,\ell}$ need not be non-negative, but they satisfy the normalization
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_agg_weights_sum}
		\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \Omega_{g,\ell} = 1~.
	\end{equation}
\end{prop}


\section{Estimands, and What Does Stacked OLS Identify?}\label{sec:regression}

Before developing the formal identification and estimation theory, I analyze the regression specifications that applied researchers commonly use for triple differences. This section characterizes exactly what each specification targets, under what conditions it recovers an interpretable causal parameter, and where the standard approach breaks down. I begin by deriving the two regression specifications that correctly target the causal estimands of interest, providing rigorous proofs for each claim. I then analyze commonly used specifications that fail to recover these estimands, diagnosing the precise source of each failure. Throughout this section I draw explicit parallels with the interaction-weighted framework of \citet{sun_estimating_2021} for difference-in-differences and the decomposition results of \citet{de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020}. The analysis proceeds without covariates; the covariate-adjusted framework is developed in Appendix \ref{app:covariates}.


\subsection{Stacked sub-experiments}

The central construction of the stacked DDD approach is that of the {stacked sub-experiment}. The following definition makes this precise.

\begin{defn}[Stacked Sub-Experiment]\label{def:stack}
	For each treatment cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ and comparison group $g_c \in \calS$ with $g_c > g$, the $g$-specific stack $\Stack_g = \Stack(g, g_c, L, K)$ consists of:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Event window}  $\{g - L, \ldots, g - 1, g, \ldots, g + K\}$, where $L \geq 1$ pre-treatment and $K \geq 0$ post-treatment periods.
		\item \textbf{Treated units}  Units with $S_i = g$ and $Q_i = 1$ (the cohort receiving treatment);
		\item \textbf{Within-group controls}  Units with $S_i = g$ and $Q_i = 0$ (same enabling group, ineligible);
		\item \textbf{Clean comparison group, eligible}  Units with $S_i = g_c$ and $Q_i = 1$;
		\item \textbf{Clean comparison group, ineligible}  Units with $S_i = g_c$ and $Q_i = 0$;
	\end{enumerate}
	The clean comparison group satisfies $g_c > g + K$, so that no unit in the comparison group is treated during the time window of the stack.
\end{defn}

Each stack $\Stack_g$ is a self-contained $2 \times 2 \times 2$-like experiment. The four cells are defined by the interaction of two binary dimensions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:four_cells}
	\underbracket{(S_i = g, Q_i = 1)}_{\text{treated}}, \quad
	\underbracket{(S_i = g, Q_i = 0)}_{\substack{\text{within-group}\\\text{control}}}, \quad
	\underbracket{(S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 1)}_{\substack{\text{comparison}\\\text{eligible}}}, \quad
	\underbracket{(S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 0)}_{\substack{\text{comparison}\\\text{ineligible}}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Estimands of Interest}\label{sub:estimands}

I now define the target parameters for the stacked DDD framework, building from cohort-specific treatment effects to aggregated event-study parameters.

\paragraph{Group-time average treatment effect.}
The fundamental building block is the group-time average treatment effect on the treated. For each treatment cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ and post-treatment period $t \geq g$, define
\begin{equation}\label{eq:att_gt}
	\ATT(g,t) = \E\left[\Yitpo{g} - \Yitpo{\infty} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1\right].
\end{equation}
This is the average causal effect of treatment for units in cohort $g$ who are eligible ($Q_i = 1$), measured at time $t$. The parameter $\ATT(g,t)$ is indexed by both the treatment cohort and time, and thus accommodates heterogeneity in treatment effects across cohorts and over time. This quantity is the DDD analogue of the group-time ATT defined by \citet{callaway_difference--differences_2021-1} in the standard DiD setting. Finally, note that $\CATT(g, e) = \ATT(g, g+e)$ under the identity $t = g + e$, so the two parameters refer to the same causal contrast.

\begin{remark}[Heterogeneous treatment effects]\label{rmk:heterogeneity}
	The parameter $\ATT(g,t)$ averages over the joint distribution of individual treatment effects for treated-eligible units in cohort $g$. No assumption of constant treatment effects within a cohort-time cell is imposed. Individual effects $Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)$ may vary arbitrarily across units sharing the same $(g, t, X_i)$: the framework permits unrestricted within-cohort heterogeneity. This stands in contrast to the three-way fixed effects regression \eqref{eq:3wfe} in \Cref{app:3wfe}, which imposes a single coefficient $\theta$ and thereby requires treatment effect homogeneity across all $(g,t)$ pairs.
\end{remark}

Within a given stack $\Stack_g = \Stack(g, g_c, L, K)$, I define the \emph{stack-specific treatment effect}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:att_stack}
	\ATT_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g,t) ~,
\end{equation}
which is the DDD estimand formed from the four cells in \eqref{eq:four_cells} within the stack's time window. This is the difference-in-difference-in-differences contrast:
\begin{multline}\label{eq:ddd_contrast}
	\ATT_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g,t) = \E\left[\Delta \Yit \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1\right] - \E\left[\Delta \Yit \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0\right] \\
	- \Big\{\E\left[\Delta \Yit \mid S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 1\right] - \E\left[\Delta \Yit \mid S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 0\right]\Big\},
\end{multline}
where $\Delta \Yit = Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,g-1}$ is the outcome change relative to the last pre-treatment period.

Applied researchers typically summarize treatment effects along the event-time axis. For event-time $e = t - g$ (periods relative to treatment onset), define the population event-study parameter
\begin{equation}\label{eq:es}
	\ES(e) = \sum_{\substack{g \in \calGtrg:\\ g + e \in \{1,\ldots,T\}}} \omega_g(e) \ATT(g, g + e), \qquad e \geq 0,
\end{equation}
where $\omega_g(e) \geq 0$ are aggregation weights satisfying $\sum_g \omega_g(e) = 1$ for each $e$. Different weight choices yield different summary parameters.

The stacked event-study estimand aggregates stack-level treatment effect estimates across treated cohorts, which is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:es_stack}
	\ES_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) = \sum_{\substack{g \in \calGtrg:\\ g + e \in \{g - L,\ldots,g+K\}}} \omega_g(e) \ATT_{\Stack_g, g_c(g)}(g, g + e),
\end{equation}
where $g_c(g)$ denotes the comparison group used for cohort $g$ and the summation ranges over cohorts for which event-time $e$ falls within the stack's window. The constraint $-L \leq e \leq K$ restricts attention to event-times within the symmetric window shared by all stacks.

\begin{remark}[Regression interpretation]\label{rem:regression_preview}
	The DDD estimand \eqref{eq:ddd_contrast} has an exact regression counterpart. Within each stack $\Stack_g$, the fully saturated OLS regression of $\DeltaY_{i,t}$ on the four cell indicators---intercept, group indicator $\one\{S_i = g\}$, eligibility indicator $\one\{Q_i = 1\}$, and their interaction $\one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}$---recovers the sample triple difference as the coefficient on the interaction term. This equivalence means that applied researchers can implement the stacked DDD estimator by running a separate OLS regression within each stack and aggregating the resulting coefficients. The key requirement is that each stack-level regression must be fully saturated in the cell indicators; imposing common slopes across cells or pooling across stacks with a single treatment coefficient alters the target estimand, as I explore in Appendix \ref{app:covariates}.
\end{remark}


\subsection{The Saturated Within-Stack Regression}\label{sub:saturated}

Consider a single stack $\Stack_g$ with four cells defined by $(S_i, Q_i) \in \{(g,1), (g,0), (g_c,1), (g_c,0)\}$. Write $n_{s,q} = \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \one\{S_i = s,  Q_i = q\}$ for the number of units in cell $(s,q)$, and $n_g = \sum_{s,q} n_{s,q}$ for the total number of units in the stack. For a fixed post-treatment period $t \geq g$, the fully saturated regression on long differences $\DeltaY_{i,t}$ is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:saturated}
	\DeltaY_{i,t} = \mu_{g,t} + \lambda_{g,t} \one\{S_i = g\} + \eta_{g,t} \one\{Q_i = 1\} + \tau_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\} + \varepsilon_{i,t}~.
\end{equation}
The coefficients $(\mu_{g,t}, \lambda_{g,t}, \eta_{g,t}, \tau_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}})$ are subscripted by $(g,t)$ to emphasize that they are population parameters specific to the stack built around cohort $g$ evaluated at time $t$. The regression has four parameters for four cell means and is exactly identified. The following proposition establishes that the OLS interaction coefficient recovers the sample triple difference.

\begin{prop}[Saturated regression recovers the triple difference]\label{prop:saturated_ols}
	In regression \eqref{eq:saturated}, the OLS coefficients are
	\begin{align}
		\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}~, \label{eq:ols_mu} \\
		\widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}~, \label{eq:ols_lambda} \\
		\widehat{\eta}_{g,t} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}~, \label{eq:ols_eta} \\
		\widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} &= \underbracket{\left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t}\right)}_{\text{within-group DD}} - \underbracket{\left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}\right)}_{\text{across-group DD}}~, \label{eq:triple_diff_ols}
	\end{align}
	where $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} = n_{s,q}^{-1}\sum_{i\colon S_i = s,  Q_i = q} \DeltaY_{i,t}$ is the cell-specific sample mean. Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, $\widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} \pto \ATT(g,t)$.
\end{prop}

The saturated regression \eqref{eq:saturated} requires no functional form assumptions whatsoever. It is purely design-based; the four-cell structure of the stack, combined with the long-differencing that removes time-invariant heterogeneity, delivers the triple difference mechanically. Each coefficient has a transparent interpretation. The intercept $\mu_{g,t}$ is the mean outcome change for comparison-ineligible units, $\lambda_{g,t}$ is the group differential for ineligible units, $\eta_{g,t}$ is the eligibility premium in the comparison group, and $\tau_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}}$ is the excess eligibility premium in the treated group---the triple difference. This parallels the two-cell structure of the saturated DiD regression, where $\tau$ captures the excess treatment-group change relative to the control; here, the additional eligibility dimension requires four cells instead of two, but the logic is identical.

\subsection{Pooled Stacked Regressions and Their Targets}\label{sub:pooled}

The within-stack saturated regression \eqref{eq:saturated} can be pooled across stacks. I first analyze the fully unrestricted pooled regression, which correctly targets the cohort-time treatment effects, and then examine restricted specifications that impose various degrees of effect homogeneity.

{The unrestricted pooled regression.} Pool all stacks into a single dataset, where each observation $(i, t, g)$ belongs to stack $\Stack_g$ with $S_i \in \{g, g_c(g)\}$ and $t \in \{g - L, \ldots, g + K\}$. The fully unrestricted regression with stack fixed effects and stack-by-cell fixed effects is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:full_hetero}
	\DeltaY_{i,t,g} = \alpha_g + \mu_{s,q,g} + \sum_{g' \in \calGtrg} \sum_{e=-L}^{K} \tau_{g',e} \one\{g = g',  S_i = g',  Q_i = 1, t = g' + e\} + \varepsilon_{i,t,g}~,
\end{equation}
where the subscript $g$ on the left indexes the stack from which the observation is drawn, $\alpha_g$ are stack fixed effects, $\mu_{s,q,g}$ are stack-by-cell fixed effects (with $(s,q) \in \{(g, 1), (g, 0), (g_c, 1), (g_c, 0)\}$ within each stack), and $\tau_{g',e}$ is a cohort-by-event-time coefficient. The summation now extends over all event-times $e \in \{-L, \ldots, K\}$, including the pre-treatment periods $e < 0$. This inclusion is deliberate---the pre-treatment coefficients $\tau_{g',e}$ for $e < 0$ serve as built-in pre-trend diagnostics, as I formalize below.

\begin{prop}[Unrestricted pooled regression equivalence]\label{prop:pooled_equiv}
	Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, The fully unrestricted regression \eqref{eq:full_hetero} is numerically identical to running the saturated regression \eqref{eq:saturated} separately within each stack for each time period. Specifically, $\widehat{\tau}_{g',e} = \widehat{\tau}_{g',g'+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}$ for all $g' \in \calGtrg$ and $e \in \{-L, \ldots, K\}$.
\end{prop}


\Cref{prop:pooled_equiv} establishes that the unrestricted pooled regression \eqref{eq:full_hetero} is a ``master regression'' that simultaneously delivers all within-stack triple differences and all within-stack pre-trend diagnostics. The pre-treatment coefficients provide a regression-based implementation of the pre-trend test---systematic departures of $\widehat{\tau}_{g',e}$ from zero for $e < 0$ signal violations of DDD-PCT.

The researcher forms the event-study parameter via post-estimation aggregation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:post_agg}
	\ESstack(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widehat{\omega}_g(e) \widehat{\tau}_{g,e}
\end{equation}
with explicit, researcher-chosen weights $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) \geq 0$ summing to one. The practical question becomes how to transparently aggregate the cohort-level estimates.
The upshot here is that estimating a {fully-saturated} event-study linear regression on the stacked dataset targets a weighted average of cohort-specific effects with \textit{strictly} positive weights. A stacked event-study regression is fully saturated when it includes a full set of stack-by-group-by-time and stack-by-eligibility-by-time fixed effects, absorbing all cell-specific time shocks. In long differences, this specification is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:stacked_es_reg}
	\DeltaY_{i,t,g} = \lambda_{s,t,g} + \eta_{q,t,g} + \sum_{\substack{e=-L \\ e \neq -1}}^{K} \tau_e \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + e\} + \varepsilon_{i,t,g}~,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{s,t,g}$ is a fixed effect for group $s \in \{g, g_c\}$ at time $t$ in stack $g$, and $\eta_{q,t,g}$ is a fixed effect for eligibility type $q \in \{0, 1\}$ at time $t$ in stack $g$. Because $\lambda_{s,t,g}$ and $\eta_{q,t,g}$ consume exactly three degrees of freedom for the four cells in stack $g$ at time $t$, the addition of the treatment indicator perfectly saturates the four cell means at every period.

The following proposition establishes that this fully-saturated stacked event-study regression is sensible: at each post-treatment event-time $e$, its coefficient is a cell-size-weighted average of the cohort-specific treatment effects with strictly positive weights summing to one. This parallels the result of \citet{sun_estimating_2021} for the fully-saturated stacked DiD event-study regression, extended here to the triple-differences setting with the additional eligibility dimension.

\begin{prop}[Estimands of the fully-saturated event-study regression]\label{prop:stacked_es_estimands}
	In the fully-saturated stacked event-study regression \eqref{eq:stacked_es_reg}, the OLS coefficient $\widehat{\tau}_e$ for each event-time $e \neq -1$ is numerically identical to a weighted average of the within-stack saturated coefficients $\widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}$
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:stacked_es_weights}
		\widehat{\tau}_e = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}~,
	\end{equation}
	where the weights $w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e)$ are strictly positive {under \Cref{as:shares}} and sum to one across $g \in \calGtrg(e)$. The weight for stack $g$ is proportional to the FWL residual variance of the treatment indicator within that stack at time $t = g+e$. Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility} and \Cref{as:shares},
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[{(i)}] {No cross-cohort contamination.} The weights $w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) > 0$.
		\item[{(ii)}] {No cross-period contamination.} For any {fixed} event-time $e$, $\widehat{\tau}_e \pto \sum_{g} w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) \CATT(g,e)$. Treatment effects from other event-times $e' \neq e$ receive exactly zero weight.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\Cref{prop:stacked_es_estimands} highlights a major advantage of the stacked DDD framework. While researchers are encouraged to compute the unrestricted cohort-specific estimates and explicitly aggregate them using transparent weights (such as cohort-size weights, as in Section \ref{sub:pooled}), running the fully-saturated stacked event-study regression provides a safe, simple alternative. It guarantees a sensible weighted average of cohort-level treatment effects, in the sense that it avoids the negative weights phenomenon entirely.

\begin{remark}[Implementing the stacked DDD as a linear regression]\label{rem:implementation_regression}
	For practitioners, the stacked DDD event-study estimator can be implemented as a single linear regression on the stacked dataset. After constructing the stacked dataset (one observation per unit $\times$ time period $\times$ stack), the regression specification \eqref{eq:stacked_es_reg} includes the following fixed effects and treatment indicators.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[{(FE1)}] \textbf{Stack $\times$ treatment status $\times$ time} $\lambda_{s,t,g}$;
		\item[{(FE2)}] \textbf{Stack $\times$ eligibility $\times$ time fixed effects} $\eta_{q,t,g}$;
		\item[{(TRT)}] \textbf{Event-time treatment indicators}.
	\end{enumerate}
	Within each stack $g$ at each time $t$, the four cells $(g,1), (g,0), (g_c,1), (g_c,0)$ have three degrees of freedom absorbed by FE1 and FE2 (the group indicator $\one\{S_i = g\}$, the eligibility indicator $\one\{Q_i = 1\}$, and a constant are jointly determined by $\lambda_{s,t,g}$ and $\eta_{q,t,g}$). The treatment indicator adds one more degree of freedom, thereby perfectly saturating the four cell means. This saturation is what ensures the regression recovers the triple difference, and guarantees a valid causal interpretation on the event-study coefficients (on the event-time treatment indicators).
\end{remark}

\subsection{Population estimands under different aggregation schemes}

The stack DDD event-study estimator \[\ESstack(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widehat{\omega}_g(e)  \widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g}(g, g+e)\] depends on the aggregation weights $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) \geq 0$, $\sum_g \widehat{\omega}_g(e) = 1$. Different weight choices target different population parameters, and the stacked DDD framework makes these targets explicit. I now formally characterize what each weighting scheme identifies when the within-stack estimators are consistent for $\ATT(g, g+e) = \CATT(g,e)$ (\Cref{thm:identification}).

\subsubsection*{Cohort-size weights.} Set $\widehat \omega_g^{\mathrm{cohort}}(e) = n_{g,1} / \sum_{g' \in \calGtrg(e)} n_{g',1}$, where $n_{g,1}$ is the number of treated-eligible units in stack $\Stack_g$ and $\calGtrg(e) = \{g \in \calGtrg \mid g + e \leq T\}$ is the set of cohorts observed at event-time $e$. The population analog is $\omega_g^{\mathrm{cohort}}(e) = \Prob(S_i = g \mid S_i \in \calGtrg(e),  Q_i = 1)$, the share of cohort $g$ among treated-eligible units observed at event-time $e$. The resulting estimand is the per-capita average treatment effect
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cohort_estimand}
	\ES^{\mathrm{cohort}}(e) \equiv \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \omega_g^{\mathrm{cohort}}(e) \CATT(g,e) = \E\left[\ATT(G_i,  G_i + e) \mid G_i + e \leq T,  Q_i = 1\right]~,
\end{equation}
which averages the cohort-specific effects weighted by the number of treated-eligible individuals in each cohort. This parameter has a direct welfare interpretation as the average effect experienced by a randomly drawn treated-eligible unit at event-time $e$, and coincides with the average effect of switching defined and discussed in \Cref{sub:existing_ddd}. It is the natural estimand when the policy question concerns aggregate impact---how much did the treated population benefit, on average? As \citet{de_chaisemartin_difference--differences_2024} emphasize, this per-capita parameter is the most policy-relevant estimand in many applications, since it reflects the actual distribution of treatment effects across the affected population.

\subsubsection*{Equal weights.} Set $\omega_g^{\mathrm{eq}}(e) = 1/|\calGtrg(e)|$, assigning each cohort equal influence regardless of its sample size. The target is the simple average of cohort-specific effects
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equal_estimand}
	\ES^{\mathrm{eq}}(e) \equiv \frac{1}{|\calGtrg(e)|}\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \CATT(g,e)~,
\end{equation}
which treats each policy adoption event---each cohort's experience of treatment---as an equally informative observation about the causal mechanism. This estimand answers the question ``what is the average treatment effect across the distinct adoption episodes observed at event-time $e$?'', weighting each cohort's evidence equally. It is appropriate when the research interest lies in the policy mechanism rather than the aggregate impact, or when one cohort is much larger than the others and the researcher does not want a single large cohort to dominate the estimate. Equal weights do not target a population-weighted parameter and should therefore be reported alongside cohort-size weights rather than as a primary specification.

\subsubsection*{Precision weights.} Set $\omega_g^{\mathrm{prec}}(e) = ({n_g/\sigma_g^2(e)})/({\sum_{g'\in\calGtrg(e)} n_{g'}/\sigma_{g'}^2(e)})$, where $\widehat{\sigma}_g^2(e)$ is a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance of $\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g}(g, g+e)$. This inverse-variance weighting minimizes the asymptotic variance of $\ESstack(e)$ when the within-stack estimators are asymptotically independent (an approximation when stacks share comparison units; see Section \ref{sec:asymptotics} for the exact variance formula that accounts for shared controls). The population target of precision weights is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:precision_estimand}
	\ES^{\mathrm{prec}}(e) \equiv \frac{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \sigma_g^{-2}(e)  \CATT(g,e)}{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \sigma_g^{-2}(e)}~,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_g^2(e)$ is the asymptotic variance of the within-stack estimator. Unlike cohort-size and equal weights, the precision-weighted estimand depends on the data generating process through the variance terms $\sigma_g^2(e)$ and therefore does not have a fixed causal interpretation that is invariant to the sampling design. In particular, two different samples from the same population will in general target different weighted averages of $\CATT(g,e)$. Precision weights are the statistically optimal choice for minimizing estimation error, but the resulting estimand is harder to interpret substantively. Researchers using precision weights should report the realized weight shares $\widehat{\omega}_g^{\mathrm{prec}}(e)$ alongside point estimates.%, as I illustrate in Remark \ref{rem:r_weights}.

\subsubsection*{General welfare weights.} The three schemes above are special cases of a general welfare-weighted aggregation. Suppose the researcher assigns welfare weights $v_g > 0$ reflecting the relative importance of cohort $g$'s treatment effect. The welfare-weighted event-study parameter is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:welfare_estimand}
	\ES^{v}(e) = \frac{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} v_g \CATT(g,e)}{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} v_g}~.
\end{equation}
The stacked DDD framework accommodates any choice of $v_g$ through the aggregation step, a flexibility that enhances interpretability in the case of stacked DDD. Making the welfare weights explicit is a key advantage of the stacked approach, as it separates the statistical problem (consistent estimation of $\CATT(g,e)$) from the aggregation problem (which cohorts matter more for the policy question at hand). This transparency echoes the recommendation of \citet{de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020} and \citet{de_chaisemartin_difference--differences_2024} that researchers should always report the weights underlying their treatment effect aggregation.


\subsection{Connection to Existing Estimators}\label{sub:existing_ddd}

\subsubsection*{The interaction-weighted DDD estimator.}
The stacked DDD is the natural triple-differences analogue of \citeauthor{sun_estimating_2021}'s (\citeyear{sun_estimating_2021}) interaction-weighted (IW) estimator for DiD. This connection reveals both the estimand targeted by the stacked estimator and the source of contamination in conventional 3WFE event-study specifications.
The event-study parameter is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:es_catt}
	\ES_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \omega_g(e) \CATT(g, e)~,
\end{equation}
where $\calGtrg(e) = \{g \in \calGtrg \mid g + e \leq T\}$ is the set of cohorts observed for at least $e$ post-treatment periods.

I define the IW-DDD estimator as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:iw_ddd}
	\widehat{\CATT}_{\mathrm{IW}}(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widehat{\omega}_g(e) \widehat{\CATT}(g, e)~,
\end{equation}
where $\widehat{\CATT}(g,e)$ is any consistent estimator of $\CATT(g,e)$ and $\widehat{\omega}_g(e)$ are non-negative weights summing to one. When $\widehat{\CATT}(g,e)$ is the within-stack estimator and the weights coincide with those used in the stacked aggregation, the IW-DDD estimator is numerically identical to $\ESstack(e)$. More formally, by \Cref{prop:pooled_equiv}, the within-stack saturated coefficient $\widehat\tau^{\mathrm{sat}}_{g,g+e}$ serves as the plug-in $\widehat\CATT(g,e)$ in \eqref{eq:iw_ddd}, and substituting into the IW-DDD definition gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:iw_representation}
	\widehat\CATT_{\mathrm{IW}}(e) = \sum_{g\in\calGtrg(e)} \widehat\omega_g(e)\,\widehat\tau^{\mathrm{sat}}_{g,g+e} = \ESstack(e) ~.
\end{equation}

\subsubsection*{The within-stack triple difference as a DDD estimator for $\CATT$.}

Following the DiD estimator for $\CATT_{e,\ell}$ in \citet{sun_estimating_2021}, I define the analogous DDD estimator for $\CATT(g,\ell)$.

\begin{defn}[DDD estimator for $\CATT$]\label{def:ddd_estimator_catt}
	For cohort $g \in \calGtrg$, event-time $\ell$, comparison group $g_c$ with $g_c > g + K$, and baseline period $s = g - 1$, the DDD estimator for $\CATT(g,\ell)$ is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:ddd_estimator_catt}
		\widehat{\delta}_{g,\ell}^{\mathrm{DDD}} = \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,g+\ell} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,g+\ell}\right) - \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,g+\ell} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,g+\ell}\right)~,
	\end{equation}
	where $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} = n_{s,q}^{-1}\sum_{i\colon S_i = s,  Q_i = q}(Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,g-1})$ is the cell-specific sample mean of long differences.
\end{defn}

This definition makes explicit that the within-stack triple difference is a cohort-specific estimator, targeting the treatment effect for a single cohort $g$ at a single event-time $\ell$, using a single comparison group $g_c$. The IW aggregation across cohorts is a separate, post-estimation step.

\begin{prop}[DDD estimator consistency for $\CATT$]\label{prop:ddd_catt_consistency}
	Under {\Cref{as:sampling}}--{\Cref{as:dddpct}}, for any valid clean comparison group $g_c$, the DDD estimator $\widehat{\delta}_{g,\ell}^{\mathrm{DDD}}$ satisfies
	\begin{align}
		\widehat{\delta}_{g,\ell}^{\mathrm{DDD}} &\pto \CATT(g,\ell) \quad \text{for all } \ell \geq 0~. \label{eq:ddd_catt_post}
	\end{align}
\end{prop}



\Cref{prop:ddd_catt_consistency} is the triple-differences analog of \citeauthor{sun_estimating_2021}'s (\citeyear{sun_estimating_2021}) Proposition~5 (DiD estimator for $\CATT_{e,\ell}$). The within-stack saturated regression coefficient $\widehat{\tau}_{g,g+\ell}^{\mathrm{sat}}$ from \Cref{prop:saturated_ols} is identical to $\widehat{\delta}_{g,\ell}^{\mathrm{DDD}}$ when the comparison group used in the saturated regression is $g_c$ and the baseline period is $g - 1$. The stacked DDD framework thus has a natural connection to the IW estimator.

\subsubsection*{The average effect of switching}
Following \citet{de_chaisemartin_difference--differences_2024}, define the average effect of switching at event-time $e$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:avsw_iw}
	\mathrm{AS}(e) = \frac{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \Prob(S_i = g, Q_i = 1) \CATT(g,e)}{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \Prob(S_i = g, Q_i = 1)}~,
\end{equation}
the population-share-weighted average of cohort-specific treatment effects at exposure $e$. This coincides with the cohort-size-weighted event-study parameter $\ES^{\mathrm{cohort}}(e)$ from \eqref{eq:cohort_estimand}. Under the stacked DDD framework, $\mathrm{AS}(e)$ is estimated by the cohort-size-weighted stacked estimator.

%% IDENTIFICATION
%% ====================================================================

\section{Identification}\label{sec:identification}

This section presents the identification strategy for stacked triple differences. I first establish nonparametric identification of the cohort-time average treatment effects within each stack, then show that the stacked construction mechanically eliminates the forbidden comparisons identified by \citet{strezhnev_decomposing_2023}, and finally develop testable implications of the identifying assumptions.

\subsection{Identification within Stacks}\label{subsec:id_within_stacks}

I now establish identification of $\ATT(g,t)$ within each stack. The main result shows that the triple difference of cell-mean outcome changes recovers the causal effect.

\begin{theorem}[Identification in Stacks]\label{thm:identification}
	Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, for each stack $\Stack_g$ with comparison group $g_c$, and for all post-treatment periods $t \geq g$~,
	\begin{align}
		\ATT(g,t) &= \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0] \notag \\
		&\quad - \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0]\right)~. \label{eq:ra_id}
	\end{align}
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}[Pairwise versus global parallel trends]\label{rmk:pairwise_pt}
	A key advantage of the stacked DDD framework is that \Cref{as:dddpct} need hold only pairwise between each treatment cohort $g$ and its specific comparison group $g_c$, rather than globally across all cohort pairs simultaneously. This is a weaker requirement than the typical ``global'' parallel trends assumption. In the stacked DDD framework, we explicitly chooses which comparison group $g_c$ to pair with each treated cohort $g$, and the identifying assumption is tailored to each pair individually. If parallel trends fails for one particular comparison group---say, because a concurrent policy shock affects the eligibility-specific trend in that group---only that stack's estimates are affected; the remaining stacks retain their validity.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Role of each cell in the stack]\label{rmk:cell_roles}
	Each of the four cells in the stack $\Stack_g$ plays a distinct identifying role. The {treated-eligible} cell $(S_i = g, Q_i = 1)$ provides observed treated outcomes---these units are the target population for $\ATT(g,t)$. The {within-group ineligible} cell $(S_i = g, Q_i = 0)$ measures the group-specific trend for cohort $g$ among ineligible units, enabling the researcher to separate the treatment effect from group-specific confounds. The {comparison-eligible} cell $(S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 1)$ measures the eligibility-specific trend absent treatment. Finally, the {comparison-ineligible} cell $(S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 0)$ anchors the comparison group's baseline, enabling the third difference that isolates the causal effect from eligibility-specific trends.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}[Identification without homogeneity]\label{rmk:id_heterogeneity}
	\Cref{thm:identification} identifies $\ATT(g,t)$ under arbitrary within-cohort treatment effect heterogeneity. The individual-level effects $Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)$ may vary freely across units sharing the same $(g, t)$, and the identification formula \eqref{eq:ra_id} recovers the average of these heterogeneous effects over the treated-eligible population without imposing any restriction on their joint distribution. In particular, no constant-effects assumption is needed.
\end{remark}

Several features of \Cref{thm:identification} merit emphasis. First, identification uses {only} data within the stack $\Stack_g$---that is, units with $S_i \in \{g, g_c\}$. No information from other treatment cohorts is needed, and no cross-stack restrictions are imposed.
Second, the identification formula in \eqref{eq:ra_id} is a {regression adjustment} representation. It recovers the counterfactual by modeling conditional outcome changes in each of the three comparison cells---$(g, 0)$, $(g_c, 1)$, and $(g_c, 0)$---and combining them to form the triple difference.
Third, the use of the long difference $\DeltaY_{i,t}$ avoids the compositional issues that arise when the comparison group's treatment status changes over time.
Finally, the identification formula \eqref{eq:ra_id} is the unconditional triple difference of cell means. When pre-treatment covariates are available, one can leverage covariate-adjusted identification results developed in Appendix \ref{app:covariates}.

%% ASYMPTOTIC THEORY
\section{Asymptotic Theory: Estimation and Inference}\label{sec:asymptotics}

This section establishes the asymptotic properties of the stacked DDD estimator. The key challenge is that comparison units may be shared across stacks (e.g., never-treated units appear in every stack), inducing cross-stack dependence that must be accounted for in variance estimation and inference.

\subsection{Estimation}

I begin with within-stack estimation of $\ATT(g,t)$, then describe aggregation across stacks to form the event-study parameter $\ESstack(e)$, discuss the treatment of multiple comparison groups, and outline the practical implementation algorithm.

Throughout, fix a treatment cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ with associated comparison group $g_c$ and stack $\Stack_g$. Let $n_g$ denote the total number of units in the stack. Write $n_{s,q} = \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \one\{S_i = s,  Q_i = q\}$ for the number of units in cell $(s,q)$, and $n_{g,1}$ for the number of treated-eligible units.

\subsubsection{Within-Stack Estimation}\label{sec:within-stack}

The identification formula (\Cref{thm:identification}) expresses $\ATT(g,t)$ as a triple difference of cell-mean outcome changes. The natural sample analog is the sample triple difference
\begin{equation}\label{eq:att-sample}
	\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g,t) = \big(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t}\big) - \big(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}\big)~,
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} = n_{s,q}^{-1}\sum_{i\colon S_i = s,  Q_i = q} \DeltaY_{i,t}$ is the cell-specific sample mean of long differences $\DeltaY_{i,t} = Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,g-1}$. % Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, $\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g,t) \pto \ATT(g,t)$ by the LLN.

As shown in Section \ref{sub:saturated}, this estimator is numerically identical to the OLS coefficient on the interaction term in the fully saturated regression \eqref{eq:saturated} within the stack. It requires no functional form assumptions and no nuisance function estimation---it is a purely design-based estimator that exploits only the four-cell structure within each stack. For the following results, I maintain the following assumption.

\begin{assumption}[Non-vanishing Stack Shares]\label{as:shares}
	As $n \to \infty$,
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[{(i)}] \emph{Cohort shares.} For each $g \in \calG = \calGtrg\cup\{\infty\}$, $n_g/n \pto \lambda_g \equiv \Prob(G_i = g)$, with $\lambda_g > 0$.
		\item[{(ii)}] \emph{Within-cohort cell shares.} For each $g \in \calG$ and each cell $(s,q) \in \{0,1\}^2$ with $\Prob(S_i = s, Q_i = q \mid G_i = g)>0$, the empirical share satisfies $n^{(g)}_{s,q}/n_g \pto \pi^{(g)}_{s,q} \equiv \Prob(S_i = s, Q_i = q \mid G_i = g) > 0$.
		\item[{(iii)}] \emph{Stack-level shares.} For each treated cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ with admissible comparison $g_c \in \mathcal{C}(g)$ and each cell $(s,q)$ in stack $g$, the within-stack share $n_{s,q}/n_g \pto \pi_{s,q}^{(g,g_c)} > 0$, where $n_g = \sum_{s,q} n_{s,q}$ aggregates over the four cells of stack $g$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:shares} requires that each cohort, each within-cohort cell, and each stack-level cell retain non-vanishing population shares. The cohort-superscripted notation $\pi^{(g)}_{s,q}$ makes explicit that the cell share is a \emph{within-cohort} conditional probability, not a marginal—different cohorts may have different $(S,Q)$-cell distributions, and the stack-level share $\pi^{(g,g_c)}_{s,q}$ derived in (iii) inherits this cohort-indexed structure. The primary sampling frame is i.i.d.\ at the unit level (\Cref{as:sampling}), hence cell shares are limits of sample proportions. Under the i.i.d. sampling frame, \Cref{as:shares}(i)--(iii) follow from the weak law of large numbers.

\begin{prop}[Within-Stack Consistency]\label{prop:within_stack_consistency}
	Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility} and \Cref{as:shares}, the sample triple difference is consistent for the cohort-time average treatment effect on the treated:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:within_consistency}
		\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g,t) \pto \ATT(g,t) \quad \text{as } n \to \infty~.
	\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\Cref{prop:within_stack_consistency} extends to estimated weights satisfying $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) \pto \omega_g(e)$, which holds in particular for cohort-size weights $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) = n_{g,1}/\sum_{g'\in\calGtrg(e)} n_{g',1}$ under \Cref{as:shares}.

\subsubsection{Aggregation Across Stacks}\label{sec:aggregation}

The within-stack estimators $\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c(g)}(g,t)$ recover cohort-time treatment effects separately for each $g$. To construct event-study parameters, I aggregate across cohorts at each relative event-time $e$. Define the stacked event-study estimator
\begin{equation}\label{eq:es-stack}
	\ESstack(e) = \sum_{\substack{g \in \calGtrg :\\ g + e  \in  \{g-L, \ldots, g+K\}}} \widehat{\omega}_g(e)  \cdot  \widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c(g)}(g, g+e)~,
\end{equation}
where $L$ and $K$ are the pre- and post-treatment window lengths and $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) \geq 0$ with $\sum_g \widehat{\omega}_g(e) = 1$ for each $e$. The summation is over all cohorts $g$ for which event-time $e$ falls within the stack window. Following my earlier discussion, I consider two choices of weights.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{1.\ Cohort-size weights.}
Set
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weights-cohort}
	\widehat{\omega}_g(e) = \frac{n_{g,1}}{\displaystyle\sum_{g' \in \calGtrg:  g'+e  \in  \{g'-L, \ldots, g'+K\}} n_{g',1}},
\end{equation}
so that each cohort's contribution is proportional to the number of treated-eligible units it contains. This weighting targets the population event-study parameter $\ES(e) = \E[\ATT(G_i, G_i + e) \mid G_i + e \in \{G_i - L, \ldots, G_i + K\}]$, which weights cohorts by their population shares. It is the natural choice when the goal is to estimate an average effect across the treated population.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{2.\ Equal weights.}
Set
\begin{equation}\label{eq:weights-equal}
	\widehat{\omega}_g(e) = \frac{1}{\big|\{g' \in \calGtrg : g'+e \in \{g'-L, \ldots, g'+K\}\}\big|},
\end{equation}
which assigns each cohort equal influence regardless of its sample size or estimation precision. Equal weighting is the most transparent aggregation scheme and places equal value on detecting treatment effects in small and large cohorts alike. However, it has no clear population interpretation and may be inefficient when cohort sizes vary substantially.

\begin{remark}
	The choice among these two weights involves a familiar trade-off. Cohort-size weights have the most transparent causal interpretation, targeting the ``per unit'' (of treatment) ATT. Equal weights are the most transparent and are robust to concerns about one or two large cohorts dominating the aggregation, but they may sacrifice both efficiency and interpretability when cohort sizes are heterogeneous. In practice, I recommend reporting results under cohort-size weights as the primary specification, with equal weights as a robustness check. I note that precision weights are statistically efficient but may assign opaque weights that change across event-times, making causal interpretation difficult. 
\end{remark}


\subsection{Inference}

The stacked event-study regression \eqref{eq:stacked_es_reg} delivers point estimates $\widehat{\tau}_e$ that are convex combinations of the within-stack triple differences (\Cref{prop:stacked_es_estimands}). However, standard OLS standard errors from this regression---the heteroskedasticity-robust  standard errors---do not correctly account for the cross-stack dependence induced by shared comparison units. Luckily, the cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVE) clustered at the original unit level {do} correctly recover the asymptotic variance. % I discuss this fully in Appendix \ref{app:proof-CRVE-validity}.
In the results that follow, all limits are taken as $n \to \infty$ with the number of periods $T$ and the number of cohorts $|\calGtrg|$ held fixed.

\begin{assumption}[Finite Second Moments]\label{as:moments}
	For each stack $\Stack_g$ with comparison group $g_c$, each cell $(s,q)$, and each $t$ in the stack window, $\E[Y_{i,t}^2 \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q] < \infty$.
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:moments} requires that outcomes have finite variance in each cell.

\begin{theorem}[Within-Stack Asymptotic Normality]\label{thm:within_stack_clt}
	Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, \Cref{as:shares}, and \Cref{as:moments}, for each stack $\Stack_g$ with comparison group $g_c$ and for $t \geq g$, {writing $\DeltaY_{i, t} \equiv Y_{i, t} - Y_{i, g - 1}$ for the long difference from the stack's baseline period $g - 1$,}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:within_clt}
		\sqrt{n_g}\Big(\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g,t) - \ATT(g,t)\Big) \dto \mathcal{N}\big(0, \Sigma_{g,t,g_c}\big)~,
	\end{equation}
	where the asymptotic variance is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:within_var}
		\Sigma_{g,t,g_c} = \sum_{(s,q)} \frac{1}{\pi_{s,q}} \Var\big(\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q\big)~,
	\end{equation}
	{and $\pi_{s, q} \equiv \lim_{n \to \infty} n_{s, q} / n_g$ is the \emph{within-stack} conditional share of cell $(s, q)$.}
	The influence function for unit $i \in \Stack_g$ is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:if_decomp}
		\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i; g, t, g_c) = \sum_{(s,q)} \frac{\one\{S_i = s,  Q_i = q\}}{\pi_{s,q}} c_{s,q} \big(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q]\big)~,
	\end{equation}
	where $c_{g,1} = +1$, $c_{g,0} = -1$, $c_{g_c,1} = -1$, $c_{g_c,0} = +1$ are the signs of the triple difference.
\end{theorem}

The influence function \eqref{eq:if_decomp} has a transparent structure. Each unit contributes through its cell-specific deviation from the cell mean, weighted by the inverse of its cell's population share and signed according to the triple-difference pattern. The variance \eqref{eq:within_var} is the sum of cell-specific variance contributions, each scaled by the inverse cell share---larger cells contribute less variance per observation, as expected.

I now turn to the asymptotic distribution of the aggregated event-study estimator $\ESstack(e)$, which combines within-stack treatment effect estimates across cohorts using weights $\omega_g(e)$.

\begin{theorem}[Stacked Event-Study CLT]\label{thm:agg_clt}
	Under the conditions of \Cref{thm:within_stack_clt}, for deterministic weights $\omega_g(e) \geq 0$ satisfying $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e) = 1$ and for event-time $e \in \{0,\ldots,K\}$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:agg_clt}
		\sqrt{n}\Big(\ESstack(e) - \ES(e)\Big) \dto \mathcal{N}\big(0, \Vstack(e)\big),
	\end{equation}
	where $n = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} n_g$ and the form of $\Vstack(e)$ depends on whether stacks share control units.
\end{theorem}

The key subtlety in the aggregated result is that when stacks share comparison units---the most common case in practice, where every stack uses the never-treated group $S_i = \infty$ as its comparison---the within-stack estimators are \emph{not} independent. The shared comparison units induce cross-stack correlation that must be accounted for in the variance formula.
To see why, consider a unit $i$ with $S_i = \infty$ that belongs to stacks $\Stack_g$ and $\Stack_{g'}$ for two distinct cohorts $g \neq g'$. The influence function contribution of this unit to the two within-stack estimators is generally non-zero for both, creating dependence between $\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c}(g, g+e)$ and $\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_{g'}, g_c}(g', g'+e)$. The following result characterizes the resulting variance structure.

\begin{prop}[Variance with Shared Controls]\label{prop:shared_var}
	When stacks share comparison units (\eg, $g_c = \infty$ for all stacks), the asymptotic variance of the aggregated estimator is:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:shared_var}
		\Vstack(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{g' \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e)  \omega_{g'}(e)  \mathrm{Cov}\big(\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i; g, g+e, g_c), \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i; g', g'+e, g_c)\big),
	\end{equation}
	where the covariance is non-zero when stacks $\Stack_g$ and $\Stack_{g'}$ share comparison units. When stacks use distinct comparison groups ($g_c(g) \neq g_c(g')$ with no shared units), the cross-terms vanish and:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:indep_var}
		\Vstack(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e)^2  \frac{\Sigma_{g, g+e, g_c(g)}}{n_g} .
	\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\begin{remark}[Magnitude of cross-stack correlation]\label{rmk:cross_corr}
	The cross-stack covariance in \eqref{eq:shared_var} arises exclusively from shared comparison units. In applications where the never-treated pool is large relative to the treated cohorts, these units receive small inverse-probability weights, and the cross-stack correlation is modest. Conversely, when the never-treated pool is small and each comparison unit receives substantial weight, the cross-stack dependence is non-negligible and ignoring it leads to confidence intervals that are too narrow.
\end{remark}

A natural estimator of $\Vstack(e)$ in \eqref{eq:shared_var} is the sample analogue based on estimated influence functions. For each unit $i$ and each stack $\Stack_g$, define $\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i; g, g+e, g_c)$ as the influence function \eqref{eq:if_decomp} evaluated at sample cell proportions and sample cell means, with $\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = 0$ for units $i \notin \Stack_g$.\footnote{To verify that this is the correct influence function, note that $\widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}} = n_g^{-1}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) + \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}$, since $\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = 0$ by the orthogonality of cell-mean residuals. The influence function captures the first-order effect of perturbing unit $i$'s outcome on the triple difference---adding a unit to cell $(g,1)$ with outcome $\DeltaY_{i,g+e}$ shifts $\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,g+e}$ by approximately $(\DeltaY_{i,g+e} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,g+e})/n_{g,1}$, which changes $\widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}$ by approximately $(\DeltaY_{i,g+e} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,g+e})/n_{g,1} = \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i)/n_g$.} The plug-in variance estimator is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:var_hat}
	\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \widehat{\omega}_g(e) \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i; g, g+e, g_c(g))\right)^{\!2}.
\end{equation}
This estimator has two important features. First, by summing the weighted influence function contributions at the unit level before squaring, it automatically captures the cross-stack covariance for shared control units. When unit $i$ belongs to multiple stacks, its contributions from different stacks are summed inside the square, producing the correct cross-terms. Second, to establish consistency of this variance estimator, I require a strengthening of the moment condition in \Cref{as:moments}.


\begin{assumption}[Finite Fourth Moments]\label{as:moments4}
	For each stack $\Stack_g$ with comparison group $g_c$, each cell $(s,q)$, and each $t$ in the stack window, $\E[Y_{i,t}^4 \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q] < \infty$.
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:moments4} strengthens the second-moment condition in \Cref{as:moments} to fourth moments. This is needed because the variance estimator \eqref{eq:var_hat} is a sample average of \emph{squared} influence functions: the law of large numbers requires that these squared terms have finite variance, which imply finite fourth moments of the outcome differences by the $c_r$ inequality.

\begin{prop}[Variance Estimator Consistency]\label{prop:var_consistency}
	Under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, \Cref{as:shares}, and \Cref{as:moments4}, for deterministic weights $\omega_g(e)$ satisfying $\sum_g \omega_g(e) = 1$, and for each event-time $e \in \{0,\ldots,K\}$~
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:var_consistency}
		\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) \pto \Vstack(e)~.
	\end{equation}
\end{prop}

\Cref{prop:var_consistency} extends to estimated weights satisfying $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) \pto \omega_g(e)$, which holds in particular for cohort-size weights $\widehat{\omega}_g(e) = n_{g,1}/\sum_{g'\in\calGtrg(e)} n_{g',1}$ under \Cref{as:shares}.
At a high-level, the proof involves showing that the plug-in variance estimator is a sample average of squared estimated influence functions that converges by the law of large numbers, with the estimation error in the influence functions controlled by all the regularity conditions above. As an immediate consequence, pointwise confidence intervals of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pointwise_ci}
	\ESstack(e) \pm z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e)/n}
\end{equation}
have asymptotically correct coverage. More precisely, \Cref{prop:var_consistency} combined with \Cref{thm:agg_clt} and Slutsky's theorem gives
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pointwise_coverage}
	\frac{\ESstack(e) - \ES(e)}{\sqrt{\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e)/n}} \dto \mathcal{N}(0,1)~,
\end{equation}
so the interval \eqref{eq:pointwise_ci} has asymptotic coverage $1-\alpha$ for each $e$.

In practice, valid inference under the fully saturated OLS regression specification applied to stacked dataset can be done via the cluster-robust standard error, where the clustering is done at the unit level. This validity is ensured under the same assumptions maintained in \Cref{prop:var_consistency}; I prove this in Appendix \ref{app:proof-CRVE-validity}.
Hence, in the case of estimating fully saturated OLS regressions on the stacked dataset, the usual cluster-robust standard errors---clustered at the level of treatment---can be used without implementing the estimator proposed in \Cref{prop:var_consistency}.

\begin{remark}[Multiplier bootstrap] \label{rem:multiplier-bootstrap}
	For uniform confidence bands across all event-times, we can implement the multiplier bootstrap proceeds as follows.
	For each bootstrap replication $b = 1, \ldots, B$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[{(i)}] Draw i.i.d.\ multiplier weights $\{\xi_i^{(b)}\}_{i=1}^{n}$ from a distribution satisfying $\E[\xi_i] = 0$, $\E[\xi_i^2] = 1$, and $\E[\xi_i^4] < \infty$. Standard choices are $\xi_i \sim N(0,1)$ or $\xi_i \in \{-1, +1\}$ with equal probability. Importantly, the \emph{same} weight $\xi_i^{(b)}$ is used for unit $i$ across all stacks containing that unit.
		\item[{(ii)}] Define
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:phi_hat_def}
			\widehat\phi_i(e) \equiv \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widehat\omega_g(e)  \widehat\psi_{\Stack_g}\big(W_i;  g,  g + e,  g_c(g)\big),
		\end{equation}
		the aggregated influence function of unit $i$ at event-time $e$, summed across all stacks the unit belongs to. Then, calculate
		\begin{equation}\label{eq:bootstrap_statistic}
			\widehat{\tau}_e^{*,(b)} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i^{(b)} \widehat{\phi}_i(e)~.
		\end{equation}
		The bootstrap variance estimator is $\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{boot}}(e) = B^{-1}\sum_{b=1}^{B} [\widehat{\tau}_e^{*,(b)}]^2$, which is asymptotically equivalent to $\widehat{V}(e)/n$.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	To construct confidence bands, let $\calE = \{-L, \ldots, K\} \setminus \{-1\}$ be the set of event-times. Compute the bootstrap critical value $c_\alpha$ as the $(1-\alpha)$-quantile of $\max_{e \in \calE} |\widehat{\tau}_e^{*,(b)}| / \sqrt{\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{boot}}(e)}$ across $b = 1, \ldots, B$. The simultaneous $(1-\alpha)$th confidence band is $\{\widehat{\tau}_e \pm c_\alpha \sqrt{\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{boot}}(e)}\}_{e \in \calE}$.
	
	The essential design feature of this bootstrap is the use of a {common} multiplier weight $\xi_i$ for each unit $i$ across all stacks. When unit $i$ belongs to stacks $\Stack_g$ and $\Stack_{g'}$, the bootstrap covariance between the two within-stack contributions is $\E[\xi_i^2] \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i) = \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)$, which correctly mimics the population covariance arising from unit $i$'s shared membership. Drawing independent multipliers for each stack--unit pair would break this dependence and yield invalid inference.
\end{remark}


\section{Empirical Illustrations}\label{sec:empirical}

I illustrate the stacked DDD framework with two applications drawn from recent empirical work that exploits staggered rollouts over a country $\times$ eligibility-group panel: \citet{hansen_national_2023}'s study of the national impacts of genetically modified crops, and \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s evaluation of Gavi's vaccine program. For both illustrations, I show the cohort-size weights in my stack DDD specification and use the never-treated groups as my clean comparison group in each stack.

\subsection{National and Global Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops}\label{sub:empirical_crops}

\cite{hansen_national_2023} study the national and global impacts of genetically modified (GM) crops. In particular, they estimate the impact of genetically modified (GM) crops on countrywide yields, harvested area, and trade ``using a triple-differences rollout design that exploits variation in the availability of GM seeds across crops, countries, and time''. In other words, there are staggered national approvals for GM cultivation across countries, a clear eligibility dimension defined at the crop level, and a multi-country panel dataset encompassing both treated and never-treated crops and countries. 
They find ``positive impacts on yields, especially in poor countries,'' and emphasize that ``without GM crops, the world would have needed 3.4 percent additional cropland to keep global agricultural output at its 2019 level.''

% \subsection{Background and Data}\label{sub:crops_background}

% \paragraph{Policy background.}
% Starting in 1996, countries began sequentially approving the commercial cultivation of GM crops. The adoption of GM varieties---primarily engineered for herbicide tolerance and insect resistance---promised significant yield gains and reduced pesticide use. However, opposition led many countries to ban GM cultivation, creating a natural experiment. The staggered rollout of GM approvals across countries over the 1996--2019 period allows us to estimate the impacts of GM adoption.

% \paragraph{DDD structure.}
Mapping their setting to my notations, the \emph{treatment-enabling group} $S_i$ records the year a country $i$ first approved GM cultivation, with never-adopting countries assigned $S_i = \infty$. \emph{Eligibility} $Q_c$ indicates whether crop $c$ has a commercially viable GM variety available globally (specifically: cotton, maize, rapeseed, and soybean, so $Q_c = 1$), whereas other field crops (e.g., rice, wheat) serve as ineligible within-country controls ($Q_c = 0$). The \emph{treatment indicator} $D_{ict} = \one\{t \geq S_i\} Q_c$ takes the value one if country $i$ has approved GM cultivation by year $t$ and crop $c$ is a GM-eligible crop.
% \paragraph{Outcomes.}
Finally, I examine four primary outcomes at the country-crop-year level: the GM adoption rate, log yield, log harvested area, and net-export share. 

I construct a stack for each GM approval cohort $g \in \calGtrg$. Within each stack, the never-treated countries ($S_i = \infty$) serve as the clean comparison group ($g_c = \infty$). 
For a given cohort $g$, the stack contains four cells: \emph{treated-eligible} (GM crops in cohort $g$ countries), \emph{within-group ineligible} (non-GM crops in cohort $g$ countries), \emph{across-group eligible} (GM crops in never-adopting countries), and \emph{across-group ineligible} (non-GM crops in never-adopting countries).

I now compare the results of the conventional 3WFE estimator (``H\&W (pooled)'', \eqref{eq:hw_original}) against a stacked OLS estimator (``Sat. OLS (stacked)'') and the triple-differences estimator of \cite{ortiz-santanna_triple_2025} (``triplediff (DR)''). For aggregating cohort-level ATTs into event-study, for my proposed method, I used cohort-size as weights, so the event-study estimates should be interpreted as ``per unit'' ATT. The event-study plots for all four outcomes are presented in Figure \ref{fig:sec11_comparison} and Figure \ref{fig:sec11_att}.

\subsubsection*{Event-Study Estimates}
Across all outcomes of interest, the stacked DDD estimator display more modest, but still statistically significant, treatment effect estimates. In particular, my results confirm most of the findings in \cite{hansen_national_2023}. Unsurprisingly, my estimates and those of ``triplediff (DR)'' are qualitatively similar. The pooled specification of HW likely inflates the treatment effect estimates by using early-adopting countries as controls for later-adopting countries in the data.

\subsubsection*{Aggregated ATT}
All estimated effects under the stacked design are uniformly less in magnitude compared to the HW results. In the case of log harvested area, the stacked OLS estimator reveals a statistically insignificant effect of GM adoption on percentage of harvest. In other cases, all the estimated aggregated ATTs are half of the estimated effects of HW.
To illustrate treatment effect heterogeneity, I show cohort-level ATTs in Figure \ref{fig:sec11_att}. 
The vertical dotted lines inside the panels plot the cohort-size weighted aggregated ATTs across these stacks, which map exactly to the corresponding pooled point estimates generated by the ``Sat. OLS (stacked)'' estimator presented in Figure \ref{fig:sec11_comparison}. 

\medskip

Overall, the alternative estimation strategy I employ here mostly confirms the positive impact of the technology on outcomes of interest, with the exception of harvested area. The main advantage of the stacked design is it deals with identification transparently, allowing practitioners to design credible sub-experiments for each cohort and better argue that identification assumption holds.


\subsection{Effective Health Aid through Gavi's Vaccine Program}\label{sub:empirical_vaccine}

I next revisit \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s evaluation of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has distributed over US\$16 billion in vaccine aid to low- and middle-income countries since its founding in 1999. \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025} identify Gavi's causal effect from the differential timing of Gavi funding across countries, vaccines, and birth cohorts, comparing Gavi-funded vaccines to non-funded vaccines within the same country and birth cohort, and comparing the same vaccines across Gavi-adopting and non-adopting countries. They estimate a triple-differences specification
\begin{equation}\label{eq:st_ols}
	Y_{ivt} = \beta_1  \mathrm{Post}_{ivt} + \theta_{iv} + \theta_{it} + \theta_{vt} + \varepsilon_{ivt} ~,
\end{equation}
with country $\times$ vaccine, country $\times$ cohort, and vaccine $\times$ cohort fixed effects, clustering standard errors by country. They report that ``Gavi's support for a vaccine increased coverage rates by $2-5$ percentage points across all vaccines, on average, and by $10-20$ percentage points for newer vaccines,'' and that ``Gavi's support for a vaccine reduced child mortality from related causes by 1 child per 1,000 live births,'' implying roughly $1.5$ million lives saved at approximately US\$9,000 per life saved. \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025} acknowledge the sensitivity of staggered 3WFE estimators to treatment-effect heterogeneity and verify robustness using \citet{borusyak_revisiting_2023}'s imputation estimator.

Here is the mapping from the context of \cite{shastry_vaccine_2025} to my notations. The treatment-enabling group $S_i$ is the year country $i$ first received Gavi funding for the vaccine targeting cause $c$, with never-funded countries assigned $S_i = \infty$. Eligibility $Q_c$ is an indicator for the cause of death being the primary target of a Gavi-funded vaccine, so respiratory, diarrheal, measles, and meningitis/encephalitis causes have $Q_c = 1$ and other under-five causes have $Q_c = 0$. The treatment indicator is $D_{ict} = \one\{t \geq S_i\} Q_c$. The cross-sectional unit is the country-cause pair, and the outcome $Y_{ict}$ is the post-neonatal mortality rate (deaths per 1,000 live births) from cause $c$ in country $i$ in year $t$.

For each Gavi-funding cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ and each Gavi-linked cause $c$, I construct a stack with never-funded countries ($S_i = \infty$) as the clean comparison group. I set $L = K = 5$ to match the 11-year window used in \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s mortality event study. I analyze two samples that parallel \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s Figure 5: the full GHO sample (``All Countries'') and the vital-registry subset restricted to years from 2005 onwards (``Post-2005 Vital Registry''), which avoids imputed mortality data at the cost of a substantially smaller set of countries.

\subsubsection*{Event-study estimates}
Figures \ref{fig:vaccine_es_all} and \ref{fig:vaccine_es_vr} report event-study coefficients from three estimators applied to the mortality panel: the pooled OLS estimator in \eqref{eq:st_ols} (``OLS (pooled)''), the saturated OLS stacked estimator (``Sat.\ OLS (stacked)''), and the triple-differences estimator of \cite{ortiz-santanna_triple_2025} (``triplediff (Reg)'').

In both samples, all three estimators display essentially flat pre-trends between $e = -5$ and $e = -2$, consistent with \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s identifying assumption that coverage of Gavi-funded vaccines would have trended similarly to coverage of non-funded vaccines absent Gavi. Post-introduction, all three estimators show a downward trend in mortality rate.

However, the three estimators disagree in magnitude. In the full sample (Figure \ref{fig:vaccine_es_all}), the pooled OLS post-treatment ATT is $-0.945$ deaths per 1,000 live births, the saturated stacked OLS estimator gives $-0.633$, and triplediff produces $-0.248$. All aggregated ATTs estimated are statistically significant. In the cleaner vital-registry subset (Figure \ref{fig:vaccine_es_vr}), the three estimates are to $-0.362$, $-0.248$, and $-0.257$ per 1,000 live births for the original specification, saturated stacked OLS estimator, and triplediff, respectively. The large gap between pooled OLS and the two stacked estimators in the full sample liekly reflects the forbidden-comparison problem in \eqref{eq:st_ols}: later-funded country-cause pairs are implicitly compared to already-funded ones whose mortality rates continue to decline in the post-treatment window, and the resulting negative weights inflate the pooled OLS point estimate. In the smaller vital-registry subset, where the treatment timing is more concentrated and the effective control pool is narrower, the three estimators roughly agree at approximately a quarter of a death per 1,000 live births.
Figures \ref{fig:vaccine_decomp_all} and \ref{fig:vaccine_decomp_vr} decompose the saturated stacked OLS estimate into its underlying cause-by-cohort stacks. 

Applying the stacked DDD methodology to Gavi's vaccine rollout reinforces \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025}'s central conclusion that Gavi-funded vaccines meaningfully reduced child mortality from related causes. In the cleaner vital-registry sample---where \citet{shastry_vaccine_2025} themselves prefer the results---the stacked estimators agree with the pooled design on a reduction of roughly a quarter of a death per 1,000 live births, so the qualitative conclusion is robust. The stacked decomposition additionally shows transparently which country-vaccine-cohort stack drive the aggregate treatment effect estimate.

\section{Proof of Decomposition Results in Section \ref{sec:hw_application}} \label[appendix]{app:proofs-hw}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp}]
	The proof follows the structure of \Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}, with the three-way demeaning operator \eqref{eq:hw_demean} replacing the two-way operator of the standard 3WFE.
	
	{Step~1. Population OLS formula via FWL.} Collect the event-time indicators in the column vector $\mathbf{R}_{i,t} = (R_e(i,t))_{e \neq -1}^{\intercal}$ and their coefficients in $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = (\alpha_e)_{e \neq -1}^{\intercal}$. By the Frisch--Waugh--Lovell theorem applied to \eqref{eq:hw_paper_notation}, the population regression coefficient vector is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_fwl_ols}
		\boldsymbol{\alpha} = \left(\sum_{t=1}^{T} \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}^{\intercal}\right]\right)^{-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}  \ddot{Y}_{i,t}\right]~.
	\end{equation}
	% where $\ddot{\cdot}$ denotes the three-way demeaning that projects out $(\alpha_i, \delta_{S_i,t}, \eta_{Q_i,t})$.
	The $j$-th component is $\alpha_j = \mathbf{e}_j^{\intercal}\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. The three-way demeaning operates via the inclusion-exclusion formula \eqref{eq:hw_demean}. For the event-time indicator $R_e(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = e\} Q_i$, the demeaned version is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_demeaned_Re}
		\ddot{R}_e(i,t) = R_e(i,t) - \overline{R}_{e,i,\cdot} - \overline{R}_{e,S_i,t} - \overline{R}_{e,Q_i,t} + \overline{R}_{e,S_i,\cdot} + \overline{R}_{e,Q_i,\cdot} + \overline{R}_{e,\cdot,t} - \overline{R}_{e,\cdot\cdot}~,
	\end{equation}
	where $\overline{R}_{e,i,\cdot} = T^{-1}\sum_{t'} R_e(i,t')$ is the unit-level time mean, $\overline{R}_{e,S_i,t} = n_{S_i}^{-1}\sum_{j\colon S_j = S_i} R_e(j,t)$ is the group-time mean, $\overline{R}_{e,Q_i,t} = n_{Q_i}^{-1}\sum_{j\colon Q_j = Q_i} R_e(j,t)$ is the eligibility-time mean, and the remaining barred quantities are the corresponding total means. This demeaning removes three channels of variation from $R_e$ that the standard 3WFE demeaning (which omits the $\overline{R}_{e,Q_i,t}$ terms) leaves in.
	
	I now compute the key group means explicitly. Fix a unit $i$ with $S_i = g \in \calGtrg$ and $Q_i = 1$ (treated-eligible). The unit-level time mean is $\overline{R}_{e,i,\cdot} = T^{-1}\one\{g + e \in \{1,\ldots,T\}\}$, since $R_e(i,t') = \one\{t' = g + e\} Q_i$ is nonzero at exactly one time period. The group-time mean is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_group_time_mean}
		\overline{R}_{e,g,t} = \frac{n_{g,1}}{n_{g,\cdot}} \one\{t = g + e\}~,
	\end{equation}
	where $n_{g,1}$ is the number of eligible units in group $g$ and $n_{g,\cdot} = n_{g,1} + n_{g,0}$ is the total number of units in group $g$. This is because $R_e(j,t) = \one\{S_j = g\} Q_j \one\{t = g+e\}$ for $j$ in group $g$, so summing over $j$ in group $g$ yields $n_{g,1} \one\{t = g+e\}$, divided by $n_{g,\cdot}$. The eligibility-time mean is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_elig_time_mean}
		\overline{R}_{e,Q_i=1,t} = \frac{1}{n_{\cdot,1}} \sum_{g' \in \calGtrg} n_{g',1} \one\{t = g' + e\}~,
	\end{equation}
	the fraction of eligible units whose event-time $e$ falls at time $t$. For ineligible units ($Q_i = 0$), $R_e(i,t) = 0$ identically, so all group means involving ineligible units are zero.
	
	{Step~2. Potential outcomes substitution and weight identification.} The observed outcome decomposes as
	\[
	Y_{i,t} = Y_{i,t}(\infty) + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{\ell} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) \left[Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)\right]~,
	\]
	since $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g+\ell\}$ selects treated-eligible units of cohort $g$ at time $g+\ell$. Applying the three-way demeaning and substituting into \eqref{eq:hw_fwl_ols}, by linearity of the demeaning operator
	\begin{align}
		\sum_t \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}\right] &= \sum_t \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}(\infty)\right] \nonumber \\
		&\qquad + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell} \sum_t \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) (Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty))\right]~. \label{eq:hw_substitution}
	\end{align}
	
	For the second term, at time $t = g + \ell$, the indicator $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}$ selects only treated-eligible units in cohort $g$, for whom $Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)$ is the individual treatment effect. Taking the conditional expectation yields $\E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(g) - Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] = \CATT(g,\ell)$. The weight on each $(g,\ell)$ term, after multiplication by the inverse covariance matrix, is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_weight_formula}
		\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = \mathbf{e}_j^{\intercal} \left(\sum_{t} \E \left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}^{\intercal}\right]\right)^{-1} \E\left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,g+\ell}  R_{g,\ell}(i, g+\ell)\right]~.
	\end{equation}
	This is identical in form to \eqref{eq:3wfe_weight_def}, except that $\ddot{\cdot}$ now denotes the three-way rather than two-way demeaning. The weight $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ is precisely the coefficient on $R_j(i,t)$ in the modified auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:hw_aux_regression}, establishing the explicit form \eqref{eq:hw_weights_explicit}. The algebraic identity \eqref{eq:hw_substitution} holds without any restriction on potential outcomes; the causal interpretation under DDD PCT is proved separately in \Cref{prop:hw_es_pt}.
	
	{Step~3.} I now verify properties~(i)--(iv). The proofs are identical to those in \Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights} because they depend only on the algebraic identity $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = R_\ell(i,t)$ and the fact that unit fixed effects absorb $Q_i \one\{S_i \in \calGtrg\}$, both of which hold under any demeaning operator that includes unit effects.
	
	{Property~(i).} Fix $\ell = j$. Summing \eqref{eq:hw_weight_formula} over $g \in \calGtrg$, the right-hand side becomes the auxiliary regression coefficient from regressing $\sum_g R_{g,j}(i,t) = R_j(i,t)$ on itself and the other event-time indicators, which equals $1$ by construction.
	
	{Property~(ii).} For $\ell \neq j$ with $\ell \neq -1$, $\sum_g R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = R_\ell(i,t)$, so $\sum_g \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ equals the auxiliary regression coefficient of $R_\ell$ on $R_j$, which is $0$ for $\ell \neq j$ since included indicators are orthogonal in the multiple regression.
	
	{Property~(iii).} For $\ell = -1$, $\sum_g R_{g,-1}(i,t) = R_{-1}(i,t)$. The key identity is
	\[
	\sum_{\ell} R_\ell(i,t) = Q_i \one\{S_i \notin \calGtrg\}~,
	\]
	which depends only on unit $i$ and is therefore absorbed by the unit fixed effects $\alpha_i$. Applying the three-way demeaning operator (which includes unit effects), the right-hand side vanishes
	\[
	\ddot{\left(Q_i \one\{S_i \in \calGtrg\}\right)} = 0~.
	\]
	By linearity, $\sum_{e \neq -1} \ddot{R}_e(i,t) + \ddot{R}_{-1}(i,t) = 0$, giving $\ddot{R}_{-1}(i,t) = -\sum_{e \neq -1} \ddot{R}_e(i,t)$. In the auxiliary regression of $R_{-1}$ on $\{R_e\}_{e \neq -1}$ and fixed effects, the FWL residuals satisfy this identity exactly, so every coefficient is $-1$. In particular, $\sum_g \omega_{g,-1}^{j,\star} = -1$.
	
	{Property~(iv).} For $g = \infty$, $R_{\infty,\ell}(i,t) = 0$ for all $(i,t,\ell)$, so $\omega_{\infty,\ell}^{j,\star} = 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:hw_es_pt}]
	By the FWL theorem applied to \eqref{eq:hw_paper_notation}, collecting event-time indicators in $\mathbf{R}_{i,t} = (R_e(i,t))_{e \neq -1}^{\intercal}$ and using the decomposition $Y_{i,t} = Y_{i,t}(\infty) + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell} R_{g,\ell}(i,t)\big(Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)\big)$, we have
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:hw_two_terms}
		\sum_t \E\left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}\right] = \underbracket{\sum_t \E\left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}(\infty)\right]}_{\text{(A)}} + \underbracket{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_\ell \sum_t \E\left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) (Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty))\right]}_{\text{(B)}}~.
	\end{equation}
	Term~(B), after premultiplication by the inverse Gram matrix and extraction of the $j$-th component, equals $\sum_{g,\ell}\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} \CATT(g,\ell)$ by \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp} and the definition of $\CATT(g,\ell)$. It remains to show that term~(A) vanishes under DDD-PCT. The three-way demeaning operator \eqref{eq:hw_demean} projects out unit fixed effects $\alpha_i$, group-by-time shocks $\delta_{S_i,t}$, and eligibility-by-time shocks $\eta_{Q_i,t}$. \Cref{as:dddpct} imposes that any remaining eligible--ineligible differential trend in $Y(\infty)$ is common across treatment groups, so $\ddot{Y}_{i,t}(\infty)$ has conditional mean zero in every $(S,Q)$-cell at every time. Since $\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}$ is cell-measurable at each $t$, the iterated-expectations argument gives $\sum_t \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}(\infty)] = \mathbf{0}$. The identity \eqref{eq:hw_contamination} follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:hw_es_noanticip}]
	Partition the sum in \eqref{eq:hw_contamination} by the sign of $\ell$. For $\ell < 0$ (including $\ell = -1$), no anticipation gives $\CATT(g,\ell) = 0$ for all $g$, so these terms vanish. Only $\ell \geq 0$ terms survive. The coefficient $\alpha_j$ is a linear combination of post-treatment effects $\CATT(g,\ell)$ for $\ell \geq 0$, even when $j < 0$.
	
	To see that $\alpha_j \neq 0$ generically for $j < 0$, note that the post-treatment weights $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ for $\ell \geq 0$ are not constrained to sum to zero across $g$ by the weight properties of \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp}. Under staggered adoption, the three-way-demeaned pre-treatment indicator $\ddot{R}_j(i,t)$ retains nonzero correlation with post-treatment cohort-specific indicators $R_{g,\ell}(i,t)$ for $\ell \geq 0$, because the relative-time composition of the sample changes across time. Therefore $\sum_g \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}  \CATT(g,\ell) \neq 0$ generically.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:hw_es_homo}]
	Starting from \eqref{eq:hw_contamination}, impose $\CATT(g,\ell) = \ATT_\ell$ for all $g$. Since $\ATT_\ell$ does not depend on $g$, it factors out of the inner sum
	\[
	\alpha_j = \sum_{\ell \neq -1} \ATT_\ell \underbracket{\left(\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}\right)}_{\overline{\omega}_\ell^{j,0}}~.
	\]
	By the weight properties of \Cref{prop:hw_es_decomp}, $\overline{\omega}_j^{j,\star} = 1$ (property~(i)), $\overline{\omega}_\ell^{j,\star} = 0$ for $\ell \neq j$, $\ell \neq -1$ (property~(ii)), and $\overline{\omega}_{-1}^{j,\star} = -1$ (property~(iii)). Collecting the surviving terms yields $\alpha_j = \ATT_j + (-1) \ATT_{-1} = \ATT_j - \ATT_{-1}$. Under no anticipation, $\ATT_{-1} = 0$, giving $\alpha_j = \ATT_j$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:hw_agg_att}]
	By \Cref{prop:hw_es_noanticip}, $\alpha_j \pto \sum_{g} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} \CATT(g,\ell)$ under DDD-PCT and no anticipation. Applying Slutsky's theorem and the continuous mapping theorem to the linear combination \eqref{eq:hw_agg_att}
	\begin{align*}
		\widehat{\ATT}_{\mathrm{agg}} &\pto \sum_{j=0}^{K} w_j \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} \CATT(g,\ell) \\
		&= \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \underbracket{\left(\sum_{j=0}^{K} w_j \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}\right)}_{\Omega_{g,\ell}} \CATT(g,\ell)~,
	\end{align*}
	which establishes \eqref{eq:hw_agg_plim} and \eqref{eq:hw_agg_weights}.
	
	I now verify the normalization \eqref{eq:hw_agg_weights_sum}. Summing $\Omega_{g,\ell}$ over $g$ and $\ell \geq 0$
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{g} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \Omega_{g,\ell} &= \sum_{j=0}^{K} w_j \sum_{g} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}~.
	\end{align*}
	For a fixed $j \geq 0$, the inner sum decomposes as follows. By property~(i), $\sum_g \omega_{g,j}^{j,\star} = 1$. By property~(ii), $\sum_g \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = 0$ for each $\ell \neq j$ with $\ell \neq -1$ and $\ell \geq 0$. The $\ell < 0$ terms are already excluded from the sum. Therefore $\sum_g \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star} = 1 + 0 = 1$ for each $j \geq 0$, and $\sum_g \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \Omega_{g,\ell} = \sum_j w_j \cdot 1 = 1$.
	
	To see that $\Omega_{g,\ell}$ can be negative, note that $\omega_{g,\ell}^{j,\star}$ for a specific $(g,\ell,j)$ is the auxiliary regression coefficient from \eqref{eq:hw_aux_regression}. This coefficient depends on the covariance between the three-way-demeaned indicators $\ddot{R}_j(i,t)$ and $R_{g,\ell}(i,t)$, evaluated through the inverse covariance matrix. Under staggered adoption with heterogeneous cohort sizes and unbalanced relative-time composition, these covariances can take either sign. For a concrete example, consider a panel with two treatment cohorts $g_1 < g_2$ and suppose $j = 0$ and $\ell = 2$. The three-way-demeaned indicator $\ddot{R}_0(i,t)$ at time $t = g_1$ has positive residual for cohort $g_1$ (which is at event-time $0$) but the same indicator at $t = g_2$ has positive residual for cohort $g_2$ (which is also at event-time $0$). Meanwhile, $R_{g_1,2}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g_1, Q_i = 1, t = g_1 + 2\}$. When $g_1 + 2 = g_2$, the calendar-time alignment means $\ddot{R}_0$ at time $g_2$ is correlated with cohort $g_2$ being at event-time $0$, which in turn is correlated with cohort $g_1$ being at event-time $2$. The sign of this residual correlation depends on relative cohort sizes and the number of eligible units in each cohort. When the eligible share $n_{g_1,1}/n_{g_1,\cdot}$ differs from $n_{g_2,1}/n_{g_2,\cdot}$, the three-way demeaning introduces asymmetric residuals, and the auxiliary regression coefficient $\omega_{g_1,2}^{0,\star}$ can be negative. Aggregating a negative $\omega_{g_1,2}^{0,\star}$ with positive $w_0$ yields a negative contribution to $\Omega_{g_1,2}$.
\end{proof}



\section{Proof of Identification Results}\label[appendix]{app:proofs}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:saturated_ols}]
	The regression \eqref{eq:saturated} is saturated, having four parameters for four cells. I show that the OLS solution equates predicted values to cell means by explicitly solving the normal equations.
	
	{Step~1. Set up the normal equations.} Let $\mathbf{x}_i = (1, \one\{S_i = g\}, \one\{Q_i = 1\}, \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\})'$ denote the $4 \times 1$ regressor vector for unit $i$. The OLS normal equations are $(\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \mathbf{X}'\mathbf{y}$, where $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = (\widehat{\mu}_{g,t}, \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t}, \widehat{\eta}_{g,t}, \widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}})'$. Since each unit belongs to exactly one cell, the regressor vector takes four distinct values
	\[
	\mathbf{x}_i = \begin{cases}
		(1, 1, 1, 1)' & \text{if } (S_i, Q_i) = (g, 1)~, \\
		(1, 1, 0, 0)' & \text{if } (S_i, Q_i) = (g, 0)~, \\
		(1, 0, 1, 0)' & \text{if } (S_i, Q_i) = (g_c, 1)~, \\
		(1, 0, 0, 0)' & \text{if } (S_i, Q_i) = (g_c, 0)~.
	\end{cases}
	\]
	Write $n_{g,\cdot} = n_{g,1} + n_{g,0}$ for the number of treated-group units and $n_{\cdot,1} = n_{g,1} + n_{g_c,1}$ for the number of eligible units. The Gram matrix is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:gram}
		\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
			n_g & n_{g,\cdot} & n_{\cdot,1} & n_{g,1} \\
			n_{g,\cdot} & n_{g,\cdot} & n_{g,1} & n_{g,1} \\
			n_{\cdot,1} & n_{g,1} & n_{\cdot,1} & n_{g,1} \\
			n_{g,1} & n_{g,1} & n_{g,1} & n_{g,1}
		\end{pmatrix}~.
	\end{equation}
	To verify, note that the $(j,k)$-entry equals $\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} x_{ij} x_{ik}$. For instance, the $(1,2)$-entry is $\sum_i \one\{S_i = g\} = n_{g,\cdot}$, the $(2,3)$-entry is $\sum_i \one\{S_i = g\}\one\{Q_i = 1\} = n_{g,1}$, and the $(3,3)$-entry is $\sum_i \one\{Q_i = 1\}^2 = n_{\cdot,1}$.
	
	Write $T_{s,q} = \sum_{i\colon S_i = s,  Q_i = q} \DeltaY_{i,t} = n_{s,q} \overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t}$ for the cell sum of long differences. The moment vector is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:moment}
		\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix}
			T_{g,1} + T_{g,0} + T_{g_c,1} + T_{g_c,0} \\
			T_{g,1} + T_{g,0} \\
			T_{g,1} + T_{g_c,1} \\
			T_{g,1}
		\end{pmatrix}~.
	\end{equation}
	
	{Step~2. Solve the normal equations by substitution.} The normal equations $(\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X})\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} = \mathbf{X}'\mathbf{y}$ yield four equations. For unit $i$ in cell $(s,q)$, the fitted value is $\widehat{y}_i = \widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} \one\{S_i = g\} + \widehat{\eta}_{g,t} \one\{Q_i = 1\} + \widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}$. I proceed by expressing the four cell-level fitted values
	\begin{alignat}{2}
		\text{Cell } (g_c, 0)\!\!&\quad \widehat{y} = \widehat{\mu}_{g,t}~, \label{eq:cell00}\\
		\text{Cell } (g, 0)\!\!&\quad \widehat{y} = \widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t}~, \label{eq:cell10}\\
		\text{Cell } (g_c, 1)\!\!&\quad \widehat{y} = \widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\eta}_{g,t}~, \label{eq:cell01}\\
		\text{Cell } (g, 1)\!\!&\quad \widehat{y} = \widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} + \widehat{\eta}_{g,t} + \widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}}~. \label{eq:cell11}
	\end{alignat}
	Since the regression is saturated (four free parameters, four cells), OLS equates the fitted value in each cell to the cell mean. Formally, the $k$-th normal equation states $\sum_i x_{ik} \widehat{y}_i = \sum_i x_{ik} y_i$, which, when partitioned by cells, reduces to $\widehat{y}_{(s,q)} = \overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t}$ for each cell. To see this explicitly, consider the fourth normal equation (corresponding to the treatment indicator $\one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}$)
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{i=1}^{n_g} \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\} \widehat{y}_i &= \sum_{i=1}^{n_g} \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\} \DeltaY_{i,t}~.
	\end{align*}
	Since $\one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}$ is nonzero only for the $n_{g,1}$ units in cell $(g,1)$, this simplifies to
	\[
	n_{g,1} (\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} + \widehat{\eta}_{g,t} + \widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}}) = T_{g,1} = n_{g,1} \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t}~.
	\]
	Applying the same argument to the second normal equation (selecting cell $(g,0)$ and cell $(g,1)$), the third (selecting cell $(g_c,1)$ and cell $(g,1)$), and the first (summing all cells), and noting that the system has a unique solution because $\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}$ is invertible whenever all cell sizes are positive (guaranteed by \Cref{as:overlap}), I obtain the cell-mean equations
	\begin{align}
		\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}~, \label{eq:solve_mu}\\
		\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t}~, \label{eq:solve_lambda}\\
		\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\eta}_{g,t} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t}~, \label{eq:solve_eta}\\
		\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} + \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} + \widehat{\eta}_{g,t} + \widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t}~. \label{eq:solve_tau}
	\end{align}
	
	{Step~3.} From \eqref{eq:solve_mu}, $\widehat{\mu}_{g,t} = \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}$. Substituting into \eqref{eq:solve_lambda} gives $\widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} = \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}$, and into \eqref{eq:solve_eta} gives $\widehat{\eta}_{g,t} = \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}$. Finally, substituting all three into \eqref{eq:solve_tau}
	\begin{align*}
		\widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} &= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t} - \widehat{\mu}_{g,t} - \widehat{\lambda}_{g,t} - \widehat{\eta}_{g,t} \\
		&= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t} - \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}\right) - \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}\right) \\
		&= \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} + \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t} \\
		&= \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,t}\right) - \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,t}\right)~,
	\end{align*}
	which is the sample triple difference \eqref{eq:triple_diff_ols}.
	
	{Step~4.} By the weak law of large numbers, each cell mean converges in probability to the corresponding population expectation, $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} \pto \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = s,  Q_i = q]$. Therefore
	\begin{align*}
		\widehat{\tau}_{g,t}^{\mathrm{sat}} &\pto \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0]\right) \\
		&\qquad - \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c,  Q_i = 0]\right) \\
		&= \ATT(g,t)~,
	\end{align*}
	where the final equality applies \Cref{thm:identification} under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:pooled_equiv}]
	{Step~1. Block-diagonal structure.} The stack fixed effects $\alpha_g$ and stack-by-cell fixed effects $\mu_{s,q,g}$ partition the data into independent blocks. The projection onto the space spanned by $\{\alpha_g, \mu_{s,q,g}\}$ operates block-diagonally, so that residualizing observation $(i,t,g)$ against these fixed effects uses only data from stack $g$. Formally, for any variable $Z_{i,t,g}$, the residual after projecting out $\{\alpha_g, \mu_{s,q,g}\}$ is
	\[
	\widetilde{Z}_{i,t,g} = Z_{i,t,g} - \frac{1}{n_{s(i),q(i)}} \sum_{\substack{j \in \Stack_g\\ S_j = S_i,  Q_j = Q_i}} \!\!\overline{Z}_{j,\cdot,g}~,
	\]
	where $\overline{Z}_{j,\cdot,g} = (L + K + 1)^{-1}\sum_{t'=g-L}^{g+K} Z_{j,t',g}$ and $s(i), q(i)$ denote unit $i$'s cell membership. In particular, the residualization of observation $(i,t,g)$ depends only on data within stack $g$ and cell $(s(i), q(i))$.
	
	{Step~2. Residualize the treatment indicators.} Consider the indicator $R_{g',e}(i,t,g) = \one\{g = g',  S_i = g',  Q_i = 1, t = g' + e\}$. This indicator is nonzero only for observations in stack $g'$ with $S_i = g'$ and $Q_i = 1$ at time $t = g' + e$. By the block-diagonal structure, its residual $\widetilde{R}_{g',e}(i,t,g)$ is nonzero only within stack $g'$. Moreover, within stack $g'$, $R_{g',e}$ is nonzero only in cell $(g', 1)$ at a single time period $t = g'+e$, so the residualized indicator is orthogonal to all other residualized indicators $\widetilde{R}_{g'',e''}$ for $(g'', e'') \neq (g', e)$.
	
	{Step~3.} By the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem, the OLS coefficient $\widehat{\tau}_{g',e}$ from the pooled regression \eqref{eq:full_hetero} equals the coefficient from the bivariate regression of $\widetilde{\DeltaY}_{i,t,g}$ on $\widetilde{R}_{g',e}(i,t,g)$. Since $\widetilde{R}_{g',e}$ is nonzero only within stack $g'$ and the residualized indicators are mutually orthogonal across $(g',e)$ pairs, this is equivalent to running a separate regression within stack $g'$ at time $t = g'+e$. The residualized regression within stack $g'$ at time $t$ reduces to the saturated regression \eqref{eq:saturated}---the stack-by-cell fixed effects absorb the intercept, group indicator, and eligibility indicator, leaving only the interaction term. The resulting coefficient is exactly the within-stack triple difference $\widehat{\tau}_{g',g'+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:stacked_es_estimands}]
	The regression under analysis is the fully-saturated stacked event-study specification \eqref{eq:stacked_es_reg}, restated here for reference:
	\[
	\DeltaY_{i,t,g} = \lambda_{s,t,g} + \eta_{q,t,g} + \sum_{\substack{e=-L \\ e \neq 0}}^{K} \tau_e \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + e\} + \varepsilon_{i,t,g}~,
	\]
	where $\lambda_{s,t,g}$ is a fixed effect for group $s \in \{g, g_c\}$ at time $t$ in stack $g$, and $\eta_{q,t,g}$ is a fixed effect for eligibility type $q \in \{0,1\}$ at time $t$ in stack $g$. Each observation $(i, t, g)$ belongs to stack $\Stack_g$, and the same unit $i$ may appear in multiple stacks. The treatment indicators $\one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + e\}$ are active only for treated-eligible units in the corresponding stack at the corresponding time. I derive the OLS coefficients $\widehat{\tau}_e$ and their probability limits in three steps.
	
	{Step~1. Block-diagonal projection and strict orthogonality.}
	Let the full design matrix of fixed effects be $\mathbf{F}$, which contains indicators for every $(s, t, g)$ and $(q, t, g)$ combination. Because these indicators are fully interacted with stack $g$ and time $t$, the projection matrix $\mathbf{M_F} = \mathbf{I} - \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{F}'\mathbf{F})^{-}\mathbf{F}'$ operates block-diagonally by $(g, t)$. Let $\widetilde{R}_e(i,t,g)$ denote the FWL residual of the event-time indicator $R_e(i,t,g) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + e\}$. Since $R_e(i,t,g)$ is non-zero only for observations in stack $g$ at exactly time $t = g+e$, its residual $\widetilde{R}_e(i,t,g)$ is strictly zero for all $t \neq g+e$ and for all stacks other than $g$.
	
	Consequently, for any two distinct event-times $e \neq e'$, the residuals are orthogonal, i.e.
	\begin{equation}
		\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{t} \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i,t,g) \widetilde{R}_{e'}(i,t,g) = 0~,
	\end{equation}
	because they are non-zero in mutually exclusive time for any given stack. By the FWL theorem, this orthogonality implies that the multiple regression \eqref{eq:stacked_es_reg} separates into independent bivariate regressions of $\widetilde{\DeltaY}_{i,t,g}$ on $\widetilde{R}_e(i,t,g)$ for each event-time $e$.
	
	{Step~2. Computing the FWL residual within each stack.}
	By Step~1, the OLS estimator for $\tau_e$ reduces to a bivariate FWL regression
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:tau_e_fwl}
		\widehat{\tau}_e = \frac{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i,g+e,g)  \widetilde{\DeltaY}_{i,g+e,g}}{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i,g+e,g)^2}~,
	\end{equation}
	where the time summation collapses entirely to $t = g+e$ because $\widetilde{R}_e(i,t,g) = 0$ for $t \neq g+e$. I now derive the FWL residual $\widetilde{R}_e$ and the resulting weight formula in complete detail.
	
	{Step~2a. Structure of the residual.} Fix a single stack $g$ and time $t = g + e$. Within this block, there are $n_g$ units partitioned into four cells $(s,q) \in \{(g,1), (g,0), (g_c,1), (g_c,0)\}$ with cell sizes $n_{g,1}, n_{g,0}, n_{g_c,1}, n_{g_c,0}$. The treatment indicator restricted to this block is $R_e(i) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1\}$, which takes the value $1$ only for treated-eligible units and $0$ otherwise. The fixed effects $\lambda_{s,t,g}$ and $\eta_{q,t,g}$, restricted to this block, span three linearly independent regressors
	\[
	\underbracket{1}_{\text{constant}}~, \qquad \underbracket{\one\{S_i = g\}}_{\text{group indicator}}~, \qquad \underbracket{\one\{Q_i = 1\}}_{\text{eligibility indicator}}~.
	\]
	Since $R_e(i) = \one\{S_i = g\} \one\{Q_i = 1\}$ and all three regressors are constant within each cell, the FWL residual $\widetilde{R}_e$ is also constant within each cell. Write $\widetilde{r}_{s,q}$ for the value of $\widetilde{R}_e$ in cell $(s,q)$. The three orthogonality conditions defining the projection are
	\begin{alignat}{2}
		\text{(O1)} &\quad \textstyle\sum_{(s,q)} n_{s,q} \widetilde{r}_{s,q} = 0 \qquad &&\text{($\widetilde{R}_e \perp 1$)}~, \label{eq:orth1} \\[
	\widetilde{r}_{g,1} = c~, \qquad
	\widetilde{r}_{g,0} = \frac{n_{g,1}}{n_{g,0}} c~, \qquad
	\widetilde{r}_{g_c,1} = -\frac{n_{g,1}}{n_{g_c,1}} c~, \qquad
	\widetilde{r}_{g_c,0} = \frac{n_{g,1}}{n_{g_c,0}} c~
	\]
	which pins down
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:c_value}
		c = \left[n_{g,1} \left(\frac{1}{n_{g,1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g,0}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c,1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c,0}}\right)\right]^{-1}~.
	\end{equation}
	Substituting \eqref{eq:c_value} into \eqref{eq:Vge_linear} delivers the closed-form for the residual variance within stack $g$:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:Vge}
		V_{g,e} = n_{g,1} c = \left(\frac{1}{n_{g,1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g,0}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c,1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c,0}}\right)^{-1}~.
	\end{equation}
	Because $\widetilde{R}_e$ is orthogonal to the fixed effects, $\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i) \DeltaY_{i,g+e} = \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i) \widetilde{\DeltaY}_{i,g+e}$. Expanding using the cell-constant structure \eqref{eq:fwl_residual_pattern},
	\begin{align}
		\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i) \DeltaY_{i,g+e} &= \sum_{(s,q)} n_{s,q}  \widetilde{r}_{s,q}  \overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,g+e} \nonumber \\
		&= c n_{g,1}  \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,g+e} - c n_{g,1}  \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,g+e} \nonumber \\
		&\qquad - c n_{g,1}  \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,g+e} + c n_{g,1}  \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,g+e} \nonumber \\
		&= c n_{g,1}\! \left(\overline{\DeltaY}_{g,1,g+e} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g,0,g+e} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,1,g+e} + \overline{\DeltaY}_{g_c,0,g+e}\right) \nonumber \\
		&= c n_{g,1}  \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}~, \label{eq:fwl_num}
	\end{align}
	where the last equality invokes the triple-difference formula \eqref{eq:triple_diff_ols} from \Cref{prop:saturated_ols}. It is now a \emph{consequence} of \eqref{eq:fwl_num} and \eqref{eq:Vge_linear} that the within-stack bivariate regression coefficient recovers the saturated triple-difference estimator:
	\[
	\frac{\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i)  \DeltaY_{i,g+e}}{\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \widetilde{R}_e(i)^2}
	= \frac{c  n_{g,1}  \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}}{V_{g,e}}
	= \frac{c  n_{g,1}  \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}}{c  n_{g,1}}
	= \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}~,
	\]
	where the second equality uses \eqref{eq:Vge_linear}.
	
	{Step~2e. Assembling the weighted average.} The overall FWL estimator \eqref{eq:tau_e_fwl} pools across stacks. Because $\widetilde{R}_e(i,g+e,g)$ has support only in stack $g$, the numerator and denominator decompose as sums of within-stack contributions. By \eqref{eq:fwl_num}, the within-stack numerator is $V_{g,e} \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}$ (using $V_{g,e} = c n_{g,1}$). Therefore
	\begin{align*}
		\widehat{\tau}_e &= \frac{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} V_{g,e} \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}}{\sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} V_{g,e}} = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) \widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}}~,
	\end{align*}
	where the FWL weights are
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:fwl_weights_def}
		w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) = \frac{V_{g,e}}{\sum_{g' \in \calGtrg(e)} V_{g',e}} = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{n_{g,1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g,0}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c,1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c,0}}\right)^{-1}}{\sum_{g' \in \calGtrg(e)} \left(\frac{1}{n_{g',1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g',0}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c(g'),1}} + \frac{1}{n_{g_c(g'),0}}\right)^{-1}}~.
	\end{equation}
	Under \Cref{as:overlap}, all four cell sizes are strictly positive, implying $V_{g,e} > 0$. Thus, $w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) \in (0, 1)$ and $\sum_g w_g^{\mathrm{FWL}}(e) = 1$, which establishes property~(i). Property~(ii) follows directly, as $\widehat{\tau}_e$ is isolated from any $\widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e'}^{\mathrm{sat}}$ for $e' \neq e$.
	
	{Step~3.}
	To derive the probability limit, scale the numerator and denominator of the weights by the total sample size $N$. Let the scaled residual variance be $\widehat{v}_{g,e} = V_{g,e}/N$. Under \Cref{as:sampling}, sample cell proportions converge to their strictly positive population counterparts by WLLN, meaning $\widehat{v}_{g,e} \pto v_{g,e}^\ast > 0$.
	By \Cref{prop:saturated_ols}, under \Cref{as:sampling}--\Cref{as:admissibility}, each within-stack estimator is consistent for its causal estimand, i.e. $\widehat{\tau}_{g,g+e}^{\mathrm{sat}} \pto \ATT(g, g+e) \equiv \CATT(g,e)$. Applying Slutsky's theorem and the continuous mapping theorem to the ratio of consistent estimators yields
	\begin{equation}
		\widehat{\tau}_e \pto \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \left( \frac{v_{g,e}^\ast}{\sum_{g'} v_{g',e}^\ast} \right) \CATT(g,e) \equiv \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} w_g^\ast(e) \CATT(g,e)~.
	\end{equation}
	This explicitly proves property~(ii) in the population limit.
\end{proof}



\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{thm:identification}]
	The target estimand is $\ATT(g,t) = \E[Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1]$. Because $Y_{i,t}(g)$ is observed for units with $S_i = g$ and $Q_i = 1$ when $t \geq g$, the identification problem reduces to recovering the counterfactual mean $\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1]$.
	
	Write the counterfactual outcome change as
	\begin{align*}
		\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1]~.
	\end{align*}
	Under no anticipation (\Cref{as:noanticipation}), $Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) = Y_{i,g-1}(g) = Y_{i,g-1}$, so the baseline outcome is observed. The DDD PCT assumption (\Cref{as:dddpct}) then implies
	\begin{align*}
		&\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0] \\
		&\quad = \E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0]~.
	\end{align*}
	Rearranging gives
	\begin{align*}
		\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] &= \E[Y_{i,g-1} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] \\
		&\quad + \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0] \\
		&\quad + \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0]\right)~.
	\end{align*}
	The first term on the right-hand side gives the baseline level for the treated-eligible cell. The second term captures the within-group trend for ineligible units in cohort $g$. The bracket term adjusts for any differential trend between eligible and ineligible units using the comparison cohort $g_c$. All three terms are expressed in terms of observed outcome changes for untreated cells.
	
	Substituting into $\ATT(g,t) = \E[Y_{i,t}(g) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1]$ and using $\E[Y_{i,t}(g) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] = \E[Y_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1]$ (observed treated outcomes) yields
	\begin{align*}
		\ATT(g,t) &= \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0] \\
		&\quad - \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0]\right)~,
	\end{align*}
	which is \eqref{eq:ra_id}~.
\end{proof}


\section{Proofs of Asymptotics Results} \label[appendix]{app:asymptotics-proofs}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:ddd_catt_consistency}]
	I prove each result by writing the population limit of the DDD estimator \eqref{eq:ddd_estimator_catt} in terms of potential outcomes and applying the identifying assumptions. By WLLN, each cell mean $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,g+\ell}$ converges in probability to its population analog $\E[\DeltaY_{i,g+\ell} \mid S_i = s,  Q_i = q]$. I now express each cell's population mean in terms of untreated potential outcomes and treatment effects. For the treated-eligible cell $(g,1)$ at time $g + \ell \geq g$, consistency gives $Y_{i,g+\ell} = Y_{i,g+\ell}(g)$ and no anticipation gives $Y_{i,g-1} = Y_{i,g-1}(\infty)$, so
	\[
	\E[\DeltaY_{i,g+\ell} \mid g,1] = \CATT(g,\ell) + \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) \mid g,1] \equiv \CATT(g,\ell) + \mu^{g,1}~.
	\]
	For the three comparison cells $(g,0)$, $(g_c,1)$, and $(g_c,0)$, all units are untreated at both times $g+\ell$ and $g-1$ (ineligible units because $Q_i = 0$, and eligible comparison units because $g_c > g + K \geq g + \ell$). Hence $\DeltaY_{i,g+\ell} = Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,g-1}(\infty)$ for each of these cells, and the population means are the untreated trend functions $\mu^{g,0}$, $\mu^{g_c,1}$, and $\mu^{g_c,0}$ respectively. The population triple difference is therefore
	\[
	(\mu^{g,1} + \CATT(g,\ell) - \mu^{g,0}) - (\mu^{g_c,1} - \mu^{g_c,0}) = \CATT(g,\ell) + (\mu^{g,1} + \mu^{g,0}) - (\mu^{g_c,1} + \mu^{g_c,0})~.
	\]
	By DDD-PCT (\Cref{as:dddpct}), the eligible--ineligible differential trend $\mu^{g,1} - \mu^{g,0}$ is the same for the treated group $g$ and the comparison group $g_c$, so the second and third terms cancel. An application of Slutsky's Theorem yields $\widehat{\delta}_{g,\ell}^{\mathrm{DDD}} \pto \CATT(g,\ell)$.
\end{proof}

%% ====================================================================
%% THEOREM 6.3: AGGREGATED CLT
%% ====================================================================

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{thm:agg_clt}]
	Fix event-time $e \in \{0, \ldots, K\}$ and deterministic weights $\omega_g(e) \geq 0$ with $\sum_g \omega_g(e) = 1$, where the sum is over $g \in \calGtrg$ with $g + e \leq T$.
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 1: Linearization.}
	The aggregated estimator is
	\[
	\ESstack(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e)  \widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c(g)}(g, g+e)~.
	\]
	By \Cref{thm:within_stack_clt}, each within-stack estimator admits the influence function representation
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_within_stack_linear}
		\widehat{\ATT}_{\Stack_g, g_c(g)}(g, g+e) - \ATT(g, g+e) = \frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) + \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(n_g^{-1/2})~,
	\end{equation}
	where I abbreviate $\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i; g, g+e, g_c(g))$. Therefore 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_agg_linear}
		\ESstack(e) - \ES(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e) \left[\frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\right] + \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(n^{-1/2})~.
	\end{equation}
	The remainder is $\mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(n^{-1/2})$ because $\sum_g \omega_g(e)  \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(n_g^{-1/2}) = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(n^{-1/2})$ when $n_g / n \to \lambda_g > 0$ for each $g$ (the proportion of units in each stack converges to a positive constant, since $T$ and $|\calGtrg|$ are fixed).
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 2: Rewrite as a single sum over all units.}
	Define the indicator $\one_g(i) = \one\{i \in \Stack_g\}$. Since each unit may belong to multiple stacks (if it is a shared comparison unit), I have
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_single_sum}
		\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e) \frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \phi_i(e)~,
	\end{equation}
	where
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_phi_def}
		\phi_i(e) = n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e) \frac{\one_g(i)}{n_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = \sum_{g i \in \Stack_g} \frac{n \omega_g(e)}{n_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)~.
	\end{equation}
	As $n \to \infty$ with $n_g / n \to \lambda_g$, I have $n/n_g \to 1/\lambda_g$, and
	\[
	\phi_i(e) \to \sum_{g i \in \Stack_g} \frac{\omega_g(e)}{\lambda_g}  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)~.
	\]
	This is a deterministic linear combination of the within-stack influence functions, summed over all stacks containing unit $i$.
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 3: Verify CLT conditions.}
	By construction, $\E[\phi_i(e)] = 0$ since $\E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)] = 0$ for each $g$. The random variables $\{\phi_i(e)\}_{i=1}^n$ are i.i.d.\ (under \Cref{as:sampling}), since $\phi_i(e)$ is a measurable function of $W_i$ and stack membership (which is determined by $S_i$).
	
	I verify finite second moments. By the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality, we have
	\begin{align*}
		\E[\phi_i(e)^2] &\overset{(1)}{=} \E\bigg[\bigg(\sum_{g i \in \Stack_g} \frac{\omega_g(e)}{\lambda_g}  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\bigg)^{\!2}\bigg] 
		\leq |\calGtrg| \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \frac{\omega_g(e)^2}{\lambda_g^2} \E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2  \one_g(i)] < \infty~,
	\end{align*}
	where (1) follows from $\E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2 \mid i \in \Stack_g] = \Sigma_{g, g+e, g_c(g)} < \infty$, and $|\calGtrg| < \infty$ since $T$ is fixed.
	Since $\{\phi_i(e)\}_{i=1}^n$ are i.i.d.\ with $\E[\phi_i(e)] = 0$ and $\E[\phi_i(e)^2] = \Vstack(e) < \infty$, the Lindeberg condition is automatically satisfied by \Cref{lem:lindeberg} (applied with $\psi_i = \phi_i(e)$ and $\sigma^2 = \Vstack(e)$). The Lindeberg--L\'evy CLT therefore gives
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_agg_clt}
		\sqrt{n}\big(\ESstack(e) - \ES(e)\big) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_i(e) + \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1) \dto \mathcal{N}\big(0, \Vstack(e)\big)~,
	\end{equation}
	where $\Vstack(e) = \E[\phi_i(e)^2]$. Expanding the square yields the covariance structure in \eqref{eq:shared_var}.
\end{proof}


%% ====================================================================
%% PROPOSITION 6.4: VARIANCE WITH SHARED CONTROLS
%% ====================================================================

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:shared_var}]
	The asymptotic variance from the proof of \Cref{thm:agg_clt} is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_Vstack}
		\Vstack(e) = \E[\phi_i(e)^2] = \E\bigg[\bigg(\sum_{g i \in \Stack_g} \frac{\omega_g(e)}{\lambda_g}  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\bigg)^{\!2}\bigg]~.
	\end{equation}
	Expanding the square given by
	\begin{align}
		\Vstack(e) &\overset{(1)}{=} \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{g' \in \calGtrg} \frac{\omega_g(e)  \omega_{g'}(e)}{\lambda_g  \lambda_{g'}} \E\left[\one_g(i)  \one_{g'}(i)  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)\right]. \label{eq:app_Vstack_expanded}
	\end{align}
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Case 1 Shared comparison units.}
	When stacks share comparison units (e.g., $g_c(g) = g_c(g') = \infty$), the set $\Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'}$ is non-empty. A unit $i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'}$ contributes non-zero influence functions to both stacks. Therefore
	\begin{align*}
		\E[\one_g(i)  \one_{g'}(i)  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)] &= \E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i) \mid i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'}]  \Prob(i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'})~.
	\end{align*}
	For units $i \notin \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'}$, at least one of $\one_g(i)$ or $\one_{g'}(i)$ is zero, so the product vanishes. In particular, for the diagonal terms ($g = g'$) 
	\[
	\E[\one_g(i)^2  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2] = \E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2 \mid i \in \Stack_g]  \Prob(i \in \Stack_g) = \Sigma_{g,g+e,g_c(g)} \lambda_{g'}~.
	\]
	For the off-diagonal terms ($g \neq g'$), the cross-covariance is generally non-zero because the same observation $W_i$ enters both $\psi_{\Stack_g}$ and $\psi_{\Stack_{g'}}$. This is the source of the cross-stack covariance in \eqref{eq:shared_var}.
	
	Substituting back into \eqref{eq:app_Vstack_expanded}, separating diagonal and off-diagonal terms 
	\begin{align}
		\Vstack(e) &= \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \frac{\omega_g(e)^2}{\lambda_g^2} \Sigma_{g,g+e,g_c(g)} \lambda_g + \sum_{\substack{g, g' \in \calGtrg \\ g \neq g'}} \frac{\omega_g(e)  \omega_{g'}(e)}{\lambda_g  \lambda_{g'}} \E[\one_g(i)  \one_{g'}(i)  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)] \notag\\
		&= \sum_{g} \frac{\omega_g(e)^2}{\lambda_g}  \Sigma_{g,g+e,g_c(g)} + \sum_{\substack{g \neq g'}} \frac{\omega_g(e)  \omega_{g'}(e)}{\lambda_g  \lambda_{g'}}  \Prob(i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'})  \E[\psi_{\Stack_g}  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}} \mid i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'}]. \label{eq:app_Vstack_intermediate}
	\end{align}
	Now note that $\Prob(i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'})$ is the population probability that a randomly drawn unit belongs to both stacks. This equals the proportion of units in the overlap specifically, if both stacks share the same comparison group $g_c = \infty$, then $\Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'} = \{i  S_i = \infty\}$ and $\Prob(i \in \Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'}) = \Prob(S_i = \infty) = \lambda_\infty$. For the general case, define the cross-stack covariance 
	\begin{align*}
		C_{g,g'}(e) &\coloneqq \E[\one_g(i)  \one_{g'}(i)  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)] \\
		&= \mathrm{Cov}\big(\one_g(i)  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i), \one_{g'}(i)  \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)\big)~,
	\end{align*}
	where the equality follows from $\E[\one_g(i)  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)] = \lambda_g  \E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) \mid i \in \Stack_g] = 0$. The overall variance can then be written compactly as
	\begin{align*}
		\Vstack(e) &= \sum_{g,g' \in \calGtrg} \frac{\omega_g(e)  \omega_{g'}(e)}{\lambda_g  \lambda_{g'}} c_{g,g'}(e) = \sum_{g,g'} \omega_g(e)  \omega_{g'}(e)  \mathrm{Cov}\big(\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i), \psi_{\Stack_{g'}}(W_i)\big)~,
	\end{align*}
	where the covariance in the last expression is taken over the joint distribution of $W_i$ (including the event that $i$ belongs to the relevant stacks), and I use the convention that $\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = 0$ when $i \notin \Stack_g$. This is \eqref{eq:shared_var}.
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Case 2 Distinct comparison groups with no shared units.}
	When $g_c(g) \neq g_c(g')$ and $\Stack_g \cap \Stack_{g'} = \varnothing$ for $g \neq g'$, each unit belongs to at most one stack. Therefore $\one_g(i) \one_{g'}(i) = 0$ for all $i$ when $g \neq g'$, and the off-diagonal terms in \eqref{eq:app_Vstack_expanded} vanish. The variance simplifies to 
	\begin{align*}
		\Vstack(e) &= \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \frac{\omega_g(e)^2}{\lambda_g^2} \Sigma_{g,g+e,g_c(g)} \lambda_g = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g(e)^2 \frac{\Sigma_{g,g+e,g_c(g)}}{\lambda_g}~.
	\end{align*}
	Since $n_g / n \to \lambda_g$, this is asymptotically equivalent to $\sum_g \omega_g(e)^2  \Sigma_{g,g+e,g_c(g)} / n_g$, yielding \eqref{eq:indep_var}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:var_consistency}] \label{app:proof_var_consistency}
	Fix an event-time $e \in \{0,\ldots,K\}$. I suppress $e$ from the notation where unambiguous, writing $\omega_g$ for $\omega_g(e)$, $\widehat{\omega}_g$ for $\widehat{\omega}_g(e)$, and $t = g + e$ for the time corresponding to cohort $g$ at event-time $e$. The proof proceeds in five steps. Throughout, I write $\mu_{s,q,t} = \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q]$ for the cell-specific population mean of long differences.
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 1: Rewrite as a sample average of squared terms.}
	Recall the aggregated influence function $\phi_i(e)$ defined in \eqref{eq:app_phi_def}~
	\[
	\phi_i(e) = \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \frac{n \omega_g}{n_g}  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)~,
	\]
	where $\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i; g, g+e, g_c(g))$ is the within-stack influence function from \eqref{eq:if_decomp}. By the argument in the proof of \Cref{thm:agg_clt} (Step~2, equation \eqref{eq:app_single_sum}), the aggregated estimator satisfies $\sqrt{n}(\ESstack(e) - \ES(e)) = n^{-1/2}\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_i(e) + \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$, and the asymptotic variance is $\Vstack(e) = \E[\phi_i(e)^2]$.
	
	Define the estimated analogue by replacing population quantities with their sample counterparts~
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_hat_phi}
		\widehat{\phi}_i(e) = \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \frac{n \widehat{\omega}_g}{n_g}  \widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i)~,
	\end{equation}
	where $\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i)$ is the estimated influence function from \eqref{eq:if_decomp} evaluated at sample cell proportions $\widehat{\pi}_{s,q} = n_{s,q}/n_g$ and sample cell means $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t}$, with $\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = 0$ for $i \notin \Stack_g$. The variance estimator \eqref{eq:var_hat} then takes the form
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_Vhat_as_avg}
		\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \widehat{\phi}_i(e)^2~.
	\end{equation}
	I must show $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{\phi}_i(e)^2 \pto \E[\phi_i(e)^2] = \Vstack(e)$.
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 2: Consistency of cell-level quantities.}
	For each stack $\Stack_g$ and each cell $(s,q) \in \{(g,1),(g,0),(g_c,1),(g_c,0)\}$, I establish consistency of the estimated cell shares and cell means.
	
	\emph{Cell shares.} The sample cell proportion is $\widehat{\pi}_{s,q} = n_{s,q}/n_g$, where $n_{s,q} = \sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \one\{S_i = s, Q_i = q\}$. By \Cref{as:sampling}, the indicators $\{\one\{S_i = s, Q_i = q\}\}_{i \in \Stack_g}$ are i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(\pi_{s,q})$. By the WLLN, $\widehat{\pi}_{s,q} \pto \pi_{s,q}$. Since $\pi_{s,q} > 0$ by \Cref{as:shares}, the continuous mapping theorem gives $1/\widehat{\pi}_{s,q} \pto 1/\pi_{s,q}$.
	
	\emph{Cell means.} The sample cell mean is $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} = n_{s,q}^{-1}\sum_{i:  S_i = s,  Q_i = q} \DeltaY_{i,t}$. By the WLLN under \Cref{as:moments}, $\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} \pto \mu_{s,q,t}$.
	
	Since the number of stacks $|\calGtrg|$ and the number of cells per stack are finite (both are bounded by a function of the fixed $T$), convergence holds jointly over all cells and stacks.
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 3: Pointwise consistency of estimated influence functions.}
	Fix a stack $\Stack_g$ and a unit $i \in \Stack_g$. The population influence function \eqref{eq:if_decomp} evaluated at unit $i$ activates exactly one cell, namely $(S_i, Q_i)$~
	\[
	\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = \frac{c_{S_i, Q_i}}{\pi_{S_i, Q_i}}\big(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i, Q_i, t}\big)~,
	\]
	where $c_{s,q} \in \{+1, -1\}$ are the triple-difference signs. The estimated version is
	\[
	\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) = \frac{c_{S_i, Q_i}}{\widehat{\pi}_{S_i, Q_i}}\big(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{S_i, Q_i, t}\big)~.
	\]
	I decompose the estimation error as
	\begin{align}
		\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) - \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) &= c_{S_i,Q_i}\left[\frac{1}{\widehat{\pi}_{S_i,Q_i}}\big(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{S_i,Q_i,t}\big) - \frac{1}{\pi_{S_i,Q_i}}\big(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t}\big)\right] \notag\\
		&= c_{S_i,Q_i}\left[\left(\frac{1}{\widehat{\pi}_{S_i,Q_i}} - \frac{1}{\pi_{S_i,Q_i}}\right)\big(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t}\big)\right] \label{eq:app_if_err_share}\\
		&\quad + c_{S_i,Q_i}\left[\frac{1}{\widehat{\pi}_{S_i,Q_i}}\big(\mu_{S_i,Q_i,t} - \overline{\DeltaY}_{S_i,Q_i,t}\big)\right]~. \label{eq:app_if_err_mean}
	\end{align}
	Define the data-level (non-unit-specific) error terms
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_data_level_errors}
		\delta_{\pi,g} \coloneqq \max_{(s,q)} \left|\frac{1}{\widehat{\pi}_{s,q}} - \frac{1}{\pi_{s,q}}\right|~, \qquad \delta_{\mu,g} \coloneqq \max_{(s,q)} \left|\overline{\DeltaY}_{s,q,t} - \mu_{s,q,t}\right|~, \qquad \delta_{\widehat{\pi},g} \coloneqq \max_{(s,q)} \frac{1}{\widehat{\pi}_{s,q}}~.
	\end{equation}
	By Step~2, $\delta_{\pi,g} = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$, $\delta_{\mu,g} = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$, and $\delta_{\widehat{\pi},g} = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$ (bounded in probability since $1/\widehat{\pi}_{s,q} \pto 1/\pi_{s,q} < \infty$). Combining \eqref{eq:app_if_err_share} and \eqref{eq:app_if_err_mean}~
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_if_err_bound}
		\big|\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) - \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\big| \leq \delta_{\pi,g} |\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t}| + \delta_{\widehat{\pi},g} \delta_{\mu,g}~.
	\end{equation}
	The first term is $\mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ times a unit-specific random variable with finite second moment (by \Cref{as:moments}); the second term is $\mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)  \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1) = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ and does not depend on the unit index.
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 4: $L^2$ convergence of the estimation error.}
	I now show that $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (\widehat{\phi}_i(e) - \phi_i(e))^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$. I consider deterministic weights first ($\widehat{\omega}_g = \omega_g$); the extension to estimated weights follows at the end.
	
	With deterministic weights, the estimation error decomposes as
	\begin{align}
		\widehat{\phi}_i(e) - \phi_i(e) &= \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \frac{n \omega_g}{n_g}\left[\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) - \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\right] + \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \omega_g\left(\frac{n}{n_g} - \frac{1}{\lambda_g}\right)\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i) \notag\\
		&\eqqcolon A_i + B_i~. \label{eq:app_AB_decomp}
	\end{align}
	By the inequality $(A_i + B_i)^2 \leq 2A_i^2 + 2B_i^2$, it suffices to show $n^{-1}\sum_i A_i^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ and $n^{-1}\sum_i B_i^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ separately.
	
	\emph{Term $B_i$.} Define $\delta_{\lambda,g} \coloneqq |n/n_g - 1/\lambda_g|$. By \Cref{as:shares}, $n_g/n \pto \lambda_g > 0$, so by the CMT, $\delta_{\lambda,g} = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$. By the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality applied to the sum over at most $|\calGtrg|$ stacks, we get
	\[
	B_i^2 \leq |\calGtrg| \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \omega_g^2  \delta_{\lambda,g}^2  \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2~.
	\]
	Averaging over $i$, we have
	\begin{align}
		\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n B_i^2 &\leq |\calGtrg| \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g^2  \delta_{\lambda,g}^2 \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2 \notag\\
		&= |\calGtrg| \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g^2  \delta_{\lambda,g}^2 \frac{n_g}{n} \underbracket{\frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2}_{\pto  \Sigma_{g,t,g_c} < \infty}~. \label{eq:app_B_bound}
	\end{align}
	The sample average of $\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2$ converges by the WLLN to $\E[\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2 \mid i \in \Stack_g] = \Sigma_{g,t,g_c} < \infty$, which holds under \Cref{as:moments} since $\psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)$ is a linear combination of cell-specific centered outcomes weighted by inverse cell shares. Since $\delta_{\lambda,g}^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ for each of the finitely many $g \in \calGtrg$, and $n_g/n = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$ and $\Sigma_{g,t,g_c} < \infty$, the entire expression in \eqref{eq:app_B_bound} is $\mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$.
	
	\emph{Term $A_i$.} Using \eqref{eq:app_if_err_bound} and the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality~
	\[
	A_i^2 \leq |\calGtrg| \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \frac{n^2  \omega_g^2}{n_g^2}\left[\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) - \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\right]^2~.
	\]
	By \eqref{eq:app_if_err_bound}, for each $g$~
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_if_err_sq}
		\left[\widehat{\psi}_{\Stack_g}(W_i) - \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)\right]^2 \leq 2 \delta_{\pi,g}^2 (\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t})^2 + 2 \delta_{\widehat{\pi},g}^2 \delta_{\mu,g}^2~.
	\end{equation}
	Averaging over $i$ and using $n^2/n_g^2 = (n/n_g)^2 = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$ by \Cref{as:shares}~
	\begin{align}
		\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n A_i^2 &\precsim \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_g^2 \frac{n}{n_g} \left[2 \delta_{\pi,g}^2 \frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} (\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t})^2 + 2 \delta_{\widehat{\pi},g}^2 \delta_{\mu,g}^2\right]~. \label{eq:app_A_bound}
	\end{align}
	The sample average of $(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t})^2$ within stack $\Stack_g$ equals $\sum_{(s,q)} (n_{s,q}/n_g) \left( n_{s,q}^{-1}\sum_{j:  S_j = s, Q_j = q} (\DeltaY_{j,t} - \mu_{s,q,t})^2 \right)$. By the WLLN, each cell-specific sample second moment satisfies
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_cell_second_moment}
		\frac{1}{n_{s,q}}\sum_{j:  S_j = s, Q_j = q} (\DeltaY_{j,t} - \mu_{s,q,t})^2 \pto \Var(\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q) < \infty~,
	\end{equation}
	where the WLLN for $(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{s,q,t})^2$ requires $\E[(\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{s,q,t})^4 \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q] < \infty$, which is ensured by \Cref{as:moments4}. It follows that
	\[
	\frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} (\DeltaY_{i,t} - \mu_{S_i,Q_i,t})^2 = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)~.
	\]
	Since $\delta_{\pi,g}^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$, $\delta_{\widehat{\pi},g}^2 = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$, and $\delta_{\mu,g}^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$, each summand in \eqref{eq:app_A_bound} is $\mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)  \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1) = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$. The sum over the finitely many $g \in \calGtrg$ preserves this rate, giving $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n A_i^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$.
	
	Combining the bounds on $A_i$ and $B_i$ via \eqref{eq:app_AB_decomp}~
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_L2_convergence}
		\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) - \phi_i(e)\big)^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)~.
	\end{equation}
	
	\medskip\noindent{Step 5: Conclude.}
	Decompose the variance estimator as
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_var_decomp}
		\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) = \underbracket{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_i(e)^2}_{T_1} + \underbracket{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left[\widehat{\phi}_i(e)^2 - \phi_i(e)^2\right]}_{T_2}~.
	\end{equation}
	
	\emph{Term $T_1$.} Since $\{\phi_i(e)\}_{i=1}^n$ are i.i.d.\ (each $\phi_i(e)$ is a measurable function of $W_i$, and $\{W_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq n}$ are i.i.d.\ by \Cref{as:sampling}) with finite mean $\E[\phi_i(e)^2] = \Vstack(e) < \infty$ (established in the proof of \Cref{thm:agg_clt}, \eqref{eq:app_agg_clt}), the WLLN gives
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_T1}
		T_1 \pto \Vstack(e)~.
	\end{equation}
	
	\emph{Term $T_2$.} By the identity $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$ and the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality for sums~
	\begin{align}
		|T_2| &= \left|\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) - \phi_i(e)\big)\big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) + \phi_i(e)\big)\right| \notag\\
		&\leq \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) - \phi_i(e)\big)^2\right)^{\!1/2} \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) + \phi_i(e)\big)^2\right)^{\!1/2}~. \label{eq:app_T2_CS}
	\end{align}
	The first factor is $\mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ by \eqref{eq:app_L2_convergence}. For the second factor, I use the inequality $(a+b)^2 \leq 2a^2 + 2b^2$ to write
	\[
	\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) + \phi_i(e)\big)^2 \leq \frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{\phi}_i(e)^2 + \frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_i(e)^2~.
	\]
	The second term converges to $2\Vstack(e)$ by \eqref{eq:app_T1}. Then, by the triangle inequality in $\ell^2$,
	\[
	\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{\phi}_i(e)^2\right)^{\!1/2} \leq \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_i(e)^2\right)^{\!1/2} + \left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \big(\widehat{\phi}_i(e) - \phi_i(e)\big)^2\right)^{\!1/2}~.
	\]
	The first term is $\mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$ by \eqref{eq:app_T1} and the second is $\mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$ by \eqref{eq:app_L2_convergence}, so $n^{-1}\sum_i \widehat{\phi}_i(e)^2 = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$. Therefore the second factor in \eqref{eq:app_T2_CS} is $\mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$, giving $|T_2| \leq \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)  \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1) = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$.
	Combining $T_1$ and $T_2$ in \eqref{eq:app_var_decomp}, we have
	\[
	\widehat{V}_{\mathrm{stack}}(e) = \Vstack(e) + \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)~.
	\]
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Extension to estimated weights.}
	When $\widehat{\omega}_g(e)$ replaces $\omega_g(e)$, the decomposition \eqref{eq:app_AB_decomp} acquires an additional term~
	\[
	C_i = \sum_{g:  i \in \Stack_g} \frac{n}{n_g}\big(\widehat{\omega}_g - \omega_g\big) \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)~.
	\]
	By the same Cauchy--Schwarz argument used for $B_i$~
	\[
	\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n C_i^2 \leq |\calGtrg| \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} (\widehat{\omega}_g - \omega_g)^2 \frac{n}{n_g} \frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{i \in \Stack_g} \psi_{\Stack_g}(W_i)^2~.
	\]
	When $\widehat{\omega}_g \pto \omega_g$ (which holds for cohort-size weights $\widehat{\omega}_g = n_g/n$ under \Cref{as:shares}, since $n_g/n \pto \lambda_g$), $(\widehat{\omega}_g - \omega_g)^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$, the sample second moment is $\mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$, and $n/n_g = \mathrm{O}_{\Prob}(1)$, so $n^{-1}\sum_i C_i^2 = \mathrm{o}_{\Prob}(1)$. The remainder of the argument is identical. \hfill$\square$
\end{proof}


\section{Covariate-Adjusted Framework}\label[appendix]{app:covariates}

This appendix develops the covariate-adjusted version of the stacked DDD framework. When pre-treatment covariates $X_i$ are available, the identifying assumptions can be weakened to hold conditional on covariates, and efficiency gains are available through regression adjustment, inverse probability weighting, or their doubly robust combination. The presentation is self-contained: I state the conditional assumptions, derive the identification results, define the estimators, and establish the asymptotic theory.

\subsubsection{Conditional DDD Parallel Changes-in-Trends}

The unconditional DDD PCT assumption (\Cref{as:dddpct}) can be strengthened to hold conditional on pre-treatment covariates.

\begin{assumption}[Conditional DDD Parallel Changes-in-Trends (PCT)]\label{as:dddpct_cond}
	For all $g \in \calGtrg$, all valid comparison groups $g_c > g$, all $t \in \{2, \ldots, T\}$ with $t \leq g_c$, and for almost all $x \in \calX$,
	\begin{multline}
		\E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1, X_i = x] - \E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0, X_i = x] \\
		= \E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1, X_i = x] - \E[\Yitpo{\infty} - Y_{i,t-1}(\infty) \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0, X_i = x]~. \label{eq:dddpct_cond}
	\end{multline}
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:dddpct_cond} requires that the difference in untreated outcome trends between eligible and ineligible units---conditional on covariates---is the same across the treated cohort $g$ and its comparison group $g_c$. The conditioning on $X_i$ allows the eligibility-specific differential trend to vary with observable characteristics, as long as this variation is common across groups. The unconditional \Cref{as:dddpct} is implied by \Cref{as:dddpct_cond} together with the overlap condition below, by integrating \eqref{eq:dddpct_cond} over the covariate distribution.

\subsubsection{Conditional Overlap}

\begin{assumption}[Conditional Overlap]\label{as:overlap_cond}
	For each stack $\Stack_g$ with comparison group $g_c$, the generalized propensity scores are bounded away from zero and one. There exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that for all cells $(s,q) \in \{(g,1), (g,0), (g_c,1), (g_c,0)\}$ and for almost all $x \in \calX$~
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:overlap_cond}
		\gps{s,q}{x} \coloneqq \Prob(S_i = s,  Q_i = q \mid X_i = x) \geq \epsilon~.
	\end{equation}
\end{assumption}

\Cref{as:overlap_cond} strengthens the unconditional overlap condition (\Cref{as:overlap}) to a conditional version. It ensures that, at every covariate value, there is positive probability of observing a unit in each of the four cells. This is essential for the inverse probability weighting and doubly robust estimators developed below, which require dividing by estimated propensity scores. In practice, the condition is enforced by trimming observations with extreme propensity score values.

\subsubsection{Identification under Conditional DDD-PCT}
The identification formula involves an integration over the covariate distribution.

\begin{theorem}[Covariate-Adjusted Identification]\label{thm:identification_cond}
	Under \Cref{as:sampling}, \Cref{as:noanticipation}, \Cref{as:overlap_cond}, and \Cref{as:dddpct_cond}, for each treatment cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ with comparison group $g_c$, and for each $t \geq g$ with $t \leq g + K$~
	\begin{align}
		\ATT(g,t) &= \E\bigg[\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1, X_i] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0, X_i] \notag\\
		&\qquad\quad - \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 1, X_i] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = g_c, Q_i = 0, X_i]\right) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1\bigg]~. \label{eq:ra_id_cond}
	\end{align}
\end{theorem}

The proof follows the same three steps as \Cref{thm:identification}, with all expectations conditioned on $X_i = x$ before integrating over the treated covariate distribution $X_i \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1$. 




\section{Three-Way Fixed-Effects in Event-Study Designs} \label[appendix]{app:3wfe}

The conventional approach to DDD estimation is the three-way fixed effects (3WFE) regression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe}
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i, t} + \theta  D_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}~,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i$ are unit fixed effects, $\gamma_t$ are time fixed effects, $\delta_{S_i, t}$ are group-by-time fixed effects, and $D_{i,t} = \one\{t \geq S_i\} Q_i$ is the treatment indicator. Despite its simplicity, the 3WFE estimator suffers from two distinct sources of bias under treatment effect heterogeneity. The analysis below extends the TWFE decomposition of \citet{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021} and the negative-weight results of \citet{de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020} to the triple-differences setting, showing that the additional eligibility dimension introduces a new channel through which contamination can enter.

\begin{prop}[3WFE decomposition]\label{prop:3wfe_decomp}
	Under heterogeneous treatment effects $\ATT(g,t) \neq \ATT(g',t')$, the 3WFE estimator $\widehat{\theta}^{\text{3WFE}}$ is a weighted average of group-time ATTs with weights that can be negative
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_decomp}
		\widehat{\theta}^{\text{3WFE}} \pto \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{t \geq g} w_{g,t}^{\text{3WFE}} \ATT(g,t) + \mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}}~,
	\end{equation}
	where the weights $w_{g,t}^{\text{3WFE}}$ depend on group sizes, the number of eligible units, and the timing of treatment adoption. Some weights can be negative. $\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}}$ arises from using already-treated units as controls in implicit $2 \times 2 \times 2$ sub-experiments \citep{strezhnev_decomposing_2023}. The stacked DDD estimator is free of both sources of bias.
\end{prop}



\begin{proof}
	The regression under analysis is the 3WFE specification \eqref{eq:3wfe}, restated here
	\[
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i, t} + \theta  D_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}~,
	\]
	where $\alpha_i$ are unit fixed effects, $\gamma_t$ are time fixed effects, $\delta_{S_i, t}$ are group-by-time fixed effects, and $D_{i,t} = \one\{t \geq S_i\} Q_i$ is the treatment indicator. I establish the decomposition in four steps---deriving the FWL residualized treatment indicator, computing it explicitly for specific units to demonstrate negative weights, identifying the forbidden comparison bias, and contrasting with the stacked estimator.
	
	{Step~1. FWL residualization of the treatment indicator.} By the Frisch--Waugh--Lovell theorem, $\widehat{\theta}^{\mathrm{3WFE}}$ equals the coefficient from regressing $\widetilde{Y}_{i,t}$ on $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$, where tildes denote residuals after projecting out all fixed effects. I derive $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ explicitly.
	
	The fixed effects in \eqref{eq:3wfe} are unit effects $\alpha_i$ and group-by-time effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$ (the time effects $\gamma_t$ are absorbed by $\delta_{S_i,t}$). Projecting out unit effects removes the unit-level time mean---$D_{i,t} - \overline{D}_{i,\cdot}$, where
	\[
	\overline{D}_{i,\cdot} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t'=1}^{T} D_{i,t'} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t'=1}^{T} \one\{t' \geq S_i\} Q_i = \frac{(T - S_i + 1)^+}{T} \cdot Q_i~.
	\]
	Projecting out group-by-time effects further removes the group-time mean, giving $D_{i,t} - \overline{D}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{S_i,t} + \overline{D}_{S_i,\cdot}$, where
	\[
	\overline{D}_{S_i,t} = \frac{1}{n_{S_i}} \sum_{j\colon  S_j = S_i} D_{j,t} = \frac{1}{n_{S_i}} \sum_{j\colon  S_j = S_i} \one\{t \geq S_j\} Q_j
	\]
	is the within-group treatment rate at time $t$, and $\overline{D}_{S_i,\cdot} = T^{-1}\sum_t \overline{D}_{S_i,t}$ is the group-level time average. The residualized treatment indicator is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:fwl_3wfe}
		\widetilde{D}_{i,t}^{\mathrm{3WFE}} = D_{i,t} - \overline{D}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{S_i, t} + \overline{D}_{S_i, \cdot}~.
	\end{equation}
	
	{Step~2. Negative weights from the FWL residual.} The FWL coefficient is
	\[
	\widehat{\theta}^{\mathrm{3WFE}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \widetilde{D}_{i,t} \widetilde{Y}_{i,t}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \widetilde{D}_{i,t}^2}~.
	\]
	I show that $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ can take negative values for not-yet-treated units, generating negative weights on certain $\ATT(g,t)$.
	
	Consider a unit $i$ with $S_i = g$ and $Q_i = 1$ (treated-eligible). At time $t \geq g$, the unit is treated, so $D_{i,t} = 1$. The unit-level time mean is $\overline{D}_{i,\cdot} = (T - g + 1)/T$. The group-time mean $\overline{D}_{g,t}$ equals the fraction of group-$g$ units that are eligible, $\overline{D}_{g,t} = n_{g,1}/n_{g,\cdot}$ for $t \geq g$ (since all eligible group-$g$ units are treated) and $\overline{D}_{g,t} = 0$ for $t < g$. Thus $\overline{D}_{g,\cdot} = ((T-g+1)/T) (n_{g,1}/n_{g,\cdot})$.
	
	Now consider a second cohort $g' > g$ and a not-yet-treated eligible unit $j$ with $S_j = g'$ and $Q_j = 1$ at time $t$ with $g \leq t < g'$. I compute the FWL residual \eqref{eq:fwl_3wfe} for this unit explicitly
	\begin{align*}
		D_{j,t} &= \one\{t \geq g'\} \cdot 1 = 0 \qquad (\text{not yet treated at time } t < g')~, \\
		\overline{D}_{j,\cdot} &= \frac{T - g' + 1}{T} > 0 \qquad (\text{positive because eventually treated})~, \\
		\overline{D}_{g',t} &= 0 \qquad (\text{no group-}g'\text{ unit is treated at } t < g')~, \\
		\overline{D}_{g',\cdot} &= \frac{T - g' + 1}{T} \frac{n_{g',1}}{n_{g',\cdot}}~.
	\end{align*}
	Substituting into the FWL formula \eqref{eq:fwl_3wfe}
	\begin{align*}
		\widetilde{D}_{j,t}^{\mathrm{3WFE}} &= D_{j,t} - \overline{D}_{j,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{g',t} + \overline{D}_{g',\cdot} \\
		&= 0 - \frac{T - g' + 1}{T} - 0 + \frac{T - g' + 1}{T} \frac{n_{g',1}}{n_{g',\cdot}} \\
		&= -\frac{T - g' + 1}{T} \left(1 - \frac{n_{g',1}}{n_{g',\cdot}}\right) \\
		&= -\frac{T - g' + 1}{T} \frac{n_{g',0}}{n_{g',\cdot}} < 0~.
	\end{align*}
	The residualized treatment indicator is strictly negative for this not-yet-treated eligible unit, because its positive unit-level time mean $\overline{D}_{j,\cdot}$ (reflecting future treatment) is not fully offset by the group-level time average $\overline{D}_{g',\cdot}$ (which is diluted by the ineligible share $n_{g',0}/n_{g',\cdot}$). The FWL numerator for this unit at this time contributes $\widetilde{D}_{j,t}^{\mathrm{3WFE}} \widetilde{Y}_{j,t} < 0$ when $\widetilde{Y}_{j,t} > 0$, effectively using this not-yet-treated unit's outcomes as a comparison but with a reversed sign. This is the mechanism through which negative weights arise. The analogous phenomenon in the TWFE DiD setting is documented by \citet{de_chaisemartin_two-way_2020} and \citet{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021}; in the DDD case, the ineligible share $n_{g',0}/n_{g',\cdot}$ introduces additional heterogeneity in the residual magnitude across cohorts.
	
	More precisely, the probability limit can be decomposed into a weighted sum over all pairwise $2 \times 2 \times 2$ sub-experiments. Following \citet{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021} and \citet{olden_triple_2022}, for each pair of cohorts $(g, g')$ with $g < g'$ and each pair of periods $(t, t')$ with $t < t'$, the 3WFE estimand receives a contribution proportional to the triple-difference contrast between these cohorts and periods. The weight on each contrast is proportional to the residual variation $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}^2$ contributed by that sub-experiment. Under staggering, some of these contrasts involve pairs $(g, g')$ with $g < g' \leq t'$ where cohort $g'$ is already treated at time $t'$, and the corresponding weights can be negative because the residualized indicator reverses sign.
	
	{Step~3. Forbidden comparisons.} The bias term $\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}}$ arises when already-treated cohorts serve as implicit controls. For two cohorts $g < g'$ with $g' \leq t$, both cohorts are treated at time $t$. The implicit DDD contrast compares the outcome changes of cohort $g$ (treated) against cohort $g'$ (also treated). Under treatment effect heterogeneity, the ``control'' group's outcomes at time $t$ reflect their own treatment effect $\ATT(g',t)$. The resulting sub-experiment triple difference estimates $\ATT(g,t) - \ATT(g',t)$ rather than $\ATT(g,t)$, generating the forbidden comparison bias
	\[
	\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}} = \sum_{\substack{g,g' \in \calGtrg\\ g < g'}} \sum_{\substack{t\\ g' \leq t}} \lambda_{g,g',t} \ATT(g',t)~,
	\]
	where $\lambda_{g,g',t}$ are the (signed) weights from the pairwise decomposition. Under effect homogeneity ($\ATT(g,t) = \tau$ for all $(g,t)$), $\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}} = 0$ and the negative weights sum to one, so $\widehat{\theta}^{\mathrm{3WFE}} \pto \tau$. Under heterogeneity, both the negative weights and the forbidden comparison bias are generically nonzero.
	
	{Step~4. The stacked estimator avoids both pathologies.} The stacked estimator avoids negative weights because each stack produces a single $\ATT(g,t)$ estimate, and the aggregation weights $\omega_g$ are chosen by the researcher to be non-negative. It avoids forbidden comparisons because each stack restricts the comparison group to units with $S_i = g_c > g + K$, ensuring no comparison unit is treated during the time window.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}[Effect homogeneity in 3WFE versus stacked DDD]\label{rmk:3wfe_ok}
	The 3WFE specification \eqref{eq:3wfe} imposes a single treatment coefficient $\theta$, implicitly assuming that the treatment effect is homogeneous across all $(g,t)$ cells. This rules out dynamic treatment effects, cohort-specific effects, and covariate-mediated heterogeneity. The stacked DDD framework targets $(g,t)$-specific parameters $\ATT(g,t)$ without any homogeneity restriction, and the aggregation to event-study parameters $\ESstack(e)$ uses researcher-chosen non-negative weights. Under homogeneous treatment effects, no staggering, and a single treatment cohort, 3WFE is consistent and numerically equivalent to the stacked estimator with a single stack. In practice, however, staggered adoption and heterogeneous effects are the norm, making the stacked alternative preferable as a default.
\end{remark}


\subsection{The Missing Fixed Effects}\label{sub:missing_fe}

Beyond the biases in \Cref{prop:3wfe_decomp}, the 3WFE specification \eqref{eq:3wfe} has a more fundamental structural deficiency. It omits eligibility-by-time fixed effects $\eta_{Q_i, t}$. A properly specified DDD regression must include all three sets of two-way interactions---unit (absorbing group-by-eligibility), group-by-time, {and} eligibility-by-time---to isolate the triple-difference variation. The specification \eqref{eq:3wfe} includes only the first two.

The correct DDD regression on levels is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correct_ddd}
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_{S_i, t} + \eta_{Q_i, t} + \tau  D_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}~,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_i$ absorbs all time-invariant unit heterogeneity (including group, eligibility, and group-by-eligibility main effects), $\delta_{S_i, t}$ are group-by-time fixed effects, and $\eta_{Q_i, t}$ are eligibility-by-time fixed effects. The time fixed effects $\gamma_t$ from the standard 3WFE are redundant since they are spanned by both $\delta_{S_i, t}$ and $\eta_{Q_i, t}$.

I now derive the FWL residualized treatment indicator for both specifications, showing precisely what variation each exploits.

{FWL residualization of the correct specification.} The three sets of fixed effects in \eqref{eq:correct_ddd} are unit effects $\alpha_i$, group-by-time effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$, and eligibility-by-time effects $\eta_{Q_i,t}$. To project $D_{i,t}$ onto the space spanned by these three sets, I apply the multi-way demeaning formula. Define the following group means of the treatment indicator
\begin{align*}
	\overline{D}_{i,\cdot} &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t'=1}^{T} D_{i,t'} & &\text{(unit-level time mean)}~, \\
	\overline{D}_{S_i,t} &= \frac{1}{n_{S_i}} \sum_{j\colon  S_j = S_i} D_{j,t} & &\text{(group-time mean)}~, \\
	\overline{D}_{Q_i,t} &= \frac{1}{n_{Q_i}} \sum_{j\colon  Q_j = Q_i} D_{j,t} & &\text{(eligibility-time mean)}~, \\
	\overline{D}_{S_i,\cdot} &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t'=1}^{T} \overline{D}_{S_i,t'} & &\text{(group mean over time)}~, \\
	\overline{D}_{Q_i,\cdot} &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t'=1}^{T} \overline{D}_{Q_i,t'} & &\text{(eligibility mean over time)}~, \\
	\overline{D}_{\cdot,t} &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n} D_{j,t} & &\text{(cross-sectional mean at time $t$)}~, \\
	\overline{D}_{\cdot\cdot} &= \frac{1}{nT}\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{t'=1}^{T} D_{j,t'} & &\text{(total mean)}~.
\end{align*}
The residualized treatment indicator after projecting out all three sets of fixed effects is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fwl_correct}
	\widetilde{D}_{i,t} = D_{i,t} - \overline{D}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{S_i, t} - \overline{D}_{Q_i, t} + \overline{D}_{S_i, \cdot} + \overline{D}_{Q_i, \cdot} + \overline{D}_{\cdot, t} - \overline{D}_{\cdot\cdot}~.
\end{equation}
This is the standard inclusion-exclusion formula for three-way demeaning. The residual $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ isolates the variation in $D_{i,t}$ that is orthogonal to all three sets of two-way interactions---precisely the triple-difference variation.

{Contrast with the 3WFE residual.} When the specification omits $\eta_{Q_i, t}$ (the standard 3WFE), the FWL residual reduces to
\[
\widetilde{D}_{i,t}^{\mathrm{3WFE}} = D_{i,t} - \overline{D}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{S_i, t} + \overline{D}_{S_i, \cdot}~,
\]
which is the residual from projecting out only unit and group-by-time effects. Comparing with \eqref{eq:fwl_correct}, the 3WFE residual fails to subtract $\overline{D}_{Q_i,t} - \overline{D}_{Q_i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{\cdot,t} + \overline{D}_{\cdot\cdot}$, which is precisely the demeaned eligibility-by-time component. As a consequence, $\widehat{\theta}^{\mathrm{3WFE}}$ is identified from variation that includes the eligibility-by-time channel---the very nuisance that DDD is designed to difference out.

The inclusion of $\eta_{Q_i, t}$ is essential for the triple-differencing logic. The DDD PCT assumption (\Cref{as:dddpct}) states that the eligible--ineligible gap in outcome trends is the same across treatment and comparison groups. Without $\eta_{Q_i, t}$, the regression requires the stronger assumption that level trends are parallel across groups---essentially a difference-in-differences assumption rather than a triple difference. The correct residual \eqref{eq:fwl_correct}, by removing the eligibility-by-time variation, ensures that identification comes only from the triple-difference variation---the extent to which the eligible--ineligible gap changes differentially across treatment and comparison groups.

{Why the omission is inconsequential in the single-cohort case.} In a single-cohort, two-period setting with treatment group $g$ and comparison group $g_c$, there are $|\calS| = 2$ groups, $T = 2$ periods, and $|Q| = 2$ eligibility types. The group-by-time fixed effects span four cells ($2 \times 2$), and the eligibility-by-time fixed effects span four cells ($2 \times 2$). The time effects $\gamma_t$ are spanned by both. With only two groups, the group-by-time effects already absorb one dimension of time variation for each group, and the unit effects absorb the group-by-eligibility cross-section. In this minimal setting, $\overline{D}_{Q_i,t} - \overline{D}_{Q_i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{\cdot,t} + \overline{D}_{\cdot\cdot}$ is a linear combination of the group-by-time demeaning terms, so the two residuals $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ and $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}^{\mathrm{3WFE}}$ coincide. The discrepancy arises in the staggered adoption setting with multiple cohorts and many periods, where the eligibility-by-time interaction varies independently of the group-by-time interaction.

For the stacked DDD estimator, this issue does not arise. Each stack operates on a $2 \times 2$ design (treated group vs.\ comparison group) within which the saturated regression \eqref{eq:saturated} automatically controls for all cell-specific effects. The four-cell structure of each stack is the regression analogue of including all three sets of two-way interactions.

\begin{remark}[Empirical illustration of the correct specification]\label{rmk:hansen_wingender}
	\citet{hansen_national_2023} study the impact of genetically modified (GM) crops on agricultural yields using a DDD design. Their main specification is
	\[
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_{\mathrm{country} \times \mathrm{crop}} + \delta_{\mathrm{country},t} + \eta_{\mathrm{crop},t} + \sum_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \beta_c \mathrm{GM}_{c,i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}~,
	\]
	where $\alpha_{\mathrm{country} \times \mathrm{crop}}$ are country-by-crop fixed effects, $\delta_{\mathrm{country},t}$ are country-by-year fixed effects, and $\eta_{\mathrm{crop},t}$ are crop-by-year fixed effects. In the notation of this paper, the unit is a country--crop pair (so $\alpha_{\mathrm{country} \times \mathrm{crop}} = \alpha_i$), the treatment group is defined by the country's GM adoption cohort (so $\delta_{\mathrm{country},t} = \delta_{S_i,t}$), and eligibility is determined by whether the crop is a GM-viable variety---cotton, soybean, maize, or rapeseed---versus a non-GM crop such as rice or wheat (so $\eta_{\mathrm{crop},t} = \eta_{Q_i,t}$). The treatment variables $\mathrm{GM}_{c,i,t}$ are crop-specific trend-break interactions. This specification maps directly to \eqref{eq:correct_ddd} and includes all three sets of two-way fixed effects. In particular, the crop-by-year effects $\eta_{\mathrm{crop},t}$ absorb the eligibility-by-time trends that the standard 3WFE specification \eqref{eq:3wfe} omits (Section \ref{sub:missing_fe}).
	
	Despite the correct fixed-effect structure, the \citet{hansen_national_2023} specification pools across treatment cohorts in a single regression, so it remains subject to the cross-cohort and cross-period contamination analyzed in Section~\Cref{app:3wfe_es_decomp}. Under treatment effect heterogeneity across adoption cohorts, the pooled coefficient is a weighted average of cohort-specific effects with potentially negative weights (\Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}). The stacked DDD estimator resolves this by estimating $\CATT(g,e)$ separately within each cohort's stack and aggregating with non-negative, researcher-chosen weights.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Decomposition of 3WFE-DDD Event-Study Coefficients}\label{sub:3wfe_es_decomp}

The IW-DDD framework of Section \ref{sub:existing_ddd} reveals exactly what goes wrong with the conventional 3WFE event-study specification under staggered adoption with heterogeneous treatment effects. I now formalize the contamination by adapting the decomposition of \citet{sun_estimating_2021} to the triple-differences setting, deriving four progressively stronger results that characterize the population regression coefficients under different sets of assumptions.

Consider the 3WFE-DDD event-study regression
\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_eventstudy}
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i,t} + \sum_{\substack{e = -L \\ e \neq -1}}^{K} \mu_e \one\{t - S_i = e\} Q_i + \epsilon_{i,t}~,
\end{equation}
which interacts the event-time indicators with the eligibility indicator $Q_i$, normalizing at $e = -1$. Denote the DDD event-time indicator $R_e(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = e\} Q_i$ and the cohort-specific event-time indicator $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + \ell\}$. The population regression coefficient $\mu_e$ is the projection of $Y_{i,t}$ onto $R_e(i,t)$, partialling out $(\alpha_i, \gamma_t, \delta_{S_i,t})$ and all other event-time indicators $\{R_{e'}(i,t)\}_{e' \neq e, -1}$.

I define the {auxiliary regression} that characterizes the implicit weights in $\mu_e$. For each cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ and event-time $\ell$, regress the cohort-specific indicator $R_{g,\ell}(i,t)$ on the same regressors as \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:aux_regression}
	R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i,t} + \sum_{\substack{e \neq -1}} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e} R_e(i,t) + \upsilon_{i,t}~.
\end{equation}
The population regression coefficient $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ measures how much of the variation in $R_{g,\ell}$ is captured by the event-time-$e$ indicator after partialling out the fixed effects and all other event-time indicators. These weights are estimable from the data without imposing any assumptions on the data generating process.

\begin{prop}[3WFE-DDD coefficient decomposition]\label{prop:3wfe_es_weights}
	The population regression coefficient $\mu_e$ from \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy} satisfies
	\begin{align}
		\mu_e &= \sum_{\ell = e}\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}  \left(\E[\Yit - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)]\right) \label{eq:3wfe_own} \\
		&\quad + \sum_{\substack{\ell \neq e \\ \ell \neq -1}} \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}  \left(\E[\Yit - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)]\right) \label{eq:3wfe_other_incl} \\
		&\quad + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,-1}^{e}  \left(\E[Y_{i,g-1} - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,g-1}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)]\right)~, \label{eq:3wfe_excl}
	\end{align}
	where $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ is the coefficient from the auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:aux_regression}, evaluated at $t = g + \ell$. The weights satisfy
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[{(i)}] own-period weights sum to one{,} $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,e}^{e} = 1${;}
		\item[{(ii)}] other included periods sum to zero{,} $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e} = 0$ for each $\ell \neq e${,} $\ell \neq -1${;}
		\item[{(iii)}] excluded period sums to negative one{,} $\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,-1}^{e} = -1${;}
		\item[{(iv)}] never-treated units receive zero weight{,} $\omega_{\infty,\ell}^{e} = 0$ for all $e,\ell${.}
	\end{enumerate}
	No assumptions on the data generating process are required.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	The regression under analysis is the 3WFE-DDD event-study specification \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy}, restated here
	\[
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i,t} + \sum_{\substack{e = -L \\ e \neq -1}}^{K} \mu_e \underbracket{\one\{t - S_i = e\} Q_i}_{R_e(i,t)} + \epsilon_{i,t}~,
	\]
	where $R_e(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = e\} Q_i$ is the DDD event-time indicator and $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g + \ell\}$ is its cohort-specific counterpart. I derive the decomposition in three steps. Step~1 writes the OLS formula in matrix form. Step~2 substitutes the potential outcomes decomposition of $Y_{i,t}$ to identify the weight structure. Step~3 proves the summation properties of the weights.
	
	{Step~1.} Collect the event-time indicators in a column vector $\mathbf{R}_{i,t} = (R_e(i,t))_{e \neq -1}^{\top}$ and their coefficients in $\boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_e)_{e \neq -1}^{\top}$. Partialling out the fixed effects $(\alpha_i, \gamma_t, \delta_{S_i,t})$, write $\ddot{X}_{i,t}$ for the residual of any variable $X_{i,t}$ after removing unit means, time means, and group-by-time means (the three-way demeaning formula of Section \ref{sub:missing_fe})
	\[
	\ddot{X}_{i,t} = X_{i,t} - \overline{X}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{X}_{S_i,t} + \overline{X}_{S_i,\cdot} - \overline{X}_{\cdot,t} + \overline{X}_{\cdot\cdot}~.
	\]
	By the Frisch--Waugh--Lovell theorem, the population regression coefficient vector is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_ols}
		\boldsymbol{\mu} = \left(\sum_{t} \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}^{\top}]\right)^{-1}\sum_{t} \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}  \ddot{Y}_{i,t}]~,
	\end{equation}
	and the $e$-th component is $\mu_e = \mathbf{e}_e^{\top}\boldsymbol{\mu}$, where $\mathbf{e}_e$ is the unit vector selecting event-time $e$.
	
	{Step~2.} The observed outcome decomposes as
	\[
	Y_{i,t} = Y_{i,t}(\infty) + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{\ell} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) \left[Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)\right]~,
	\]
	since $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g+\ell\}$ selects treated-eligible units of cohort $g$ at time $g+\ell$, and $Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)$ is their individual-level treatment effect. Substituting into \eqref{eq:3wfe_ols}, the demeaned outcome is
	\[
	\ddot{Y}_{i,t} = \ddot{Y}_{i,t}(\infty) + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell} \ddot{R}_{g,\ell}(i,t) \left[Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty)\right]~,
	\]
	where I use the fact that demeaning is linear. Although $\ddot{(R_{g,\ell} \cdot Z)} \neq \ddot{R}_{g,\ell} \cdot Z$ in general, the cross-product structure allows us to write
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_t \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}] &= \sum_t \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{Y}_{i,t}(\infty)] \\
		&\qquad + \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell} \sum_t \E\left[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) (Y_{i,t}(g) - Y_{i,t}(\infty))\right]~.
	\end{align*}
	The first term vanishes under DDD PCT (since it contains the ``baseline'' trends), and the coefficient on each $(g,\ell)$ term, after multiplication by the inverse covariance matrix, yields
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_weight_def}
		\omega_{g,\ell}^{e} = \mathbf{e}_e^{\top}\left(\sum_{t} \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}^{\top}]\right)^{-1} \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,g+\ell}  R_{g,\ell}(i, g+\ell)]~.
	\end{equation}
	This is precisely the population regression coefficient on $R_e(i,t)$ from regressing $R_{g,\ell}(i,t)$ on the full set of event-time indicators $\mathbf{R}_{i,t}$ and the fixed effects---the auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:aux_regression}. The decomposition \eqref{eq:3wfe_own}--\eqref{eq:3wfe_excl} follows by grouping the $(g,\ell)$ terms---those with $\ell = e$ contribute to \eqref{eq:3wfe_own}, those with $\ell \neq e$ and $\ell \neq -1$ to \eqref{eq:3wfe_other_incl}, and those with $\ell = -1$ to \eqref{eq:3wfe_excl}.
	
	{Step~3.} I now prove each property by summing \eqref{eq:3wfe_weight_def} over $g$.
	
	{Property~(i), own-period weights sum to one.} Fix $\ell = e$ and sum \eqref{eq:3wfe_weight_def} over $g \in \calGtrg$
	\[
	\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,e}^{e} = \mathbf{e}_e^{\top}\left(\sum_{t} \E[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t} \ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,t}^{\top}]\right)^{-1} \E\bigg[\ddot{\mathbf{R}}_{i,g+e} \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} R_{g,e}(i, g+e)\bigg]~.
	\]
	Since $\sum_{g} R_{g,e}(i,t) = R_e(i,t)$ for all $(i,t)$ (summing over cohorts recovers the aggregate event-time indicator), this becomes the coefficient from the auxiliary regression of $R_e$ on itself and the other event-time indicators, which equals~$1$ by construction.
	
	{Property~(ii), other included periods sum to zero.} For $\ell \neq e$ with $\ell \neq -1$, $\sum_{g} R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = R_\ell(i,t)$, so the sum $\sum_g \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ equals the auxiliary regression coefficient of $R_\ell$ on $R_e$, which is $0$ for $\ell \neq e$ since included indicators have coefficient~$0$ on each other in the multiple regression.
	
	{Property~(iii), excluded period sums to $-1$.} For $\ell = -1$, the sum $\sum_g R_{g,-1}(i,t) = R_{-1}(i,t)$ recovers the excluded indicator, so $\sum_g \omega_{g,-1}^{e}$ equals the auxiliary regression coefficient from regressing $R_{-1}$ on $\{R_{e'}\}_{e' \neq -1}$ and the fixed effects. I now derive this coefficient from first principles. For any $(i,t)$, $R_\ell(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = \ell\} Q_i$. Summing over all event-times $\ell$, the indicators $\one\{t - S_i = \ell\}$ are mutually exclusive and exactly one equals $1$ when $S_i \in \calGtrg$ (namely, the unique $\ell$ satisfying $\ell = t - S_i$), while none equals $1$ when $S_i = \infty$. Therefore
	\[
	\sum_{\ell} R_\ell(i,t) = Q_i \one\{S_i \in \calGtrg\}~.
	\]
	Splitting this sum into included and excluded event-times gives $\sum_{e' \neq -1} R_{e'}(i,t) + R_{-1}(i,t) = Q_i \one\{S_i \in \calGtrg\}$. The right-hand side is a function of unit $i$ alone (it does not depend on $t$), so it is absorbed entirely by the unit fixed effects $\alpha_i$. Applying the three-way demeaning operator (which subtracts unit, time, and group-by-time means), the right-hand side vanishes
	\[
	\ddot{\left(Q_i \one\{S_i \in \calGtrg\}\right)} = 0~,
	\]
	and since demeaning is linear, the left-hand side gives
	\[
	\sum_{e' \neq -1} \ddot{R}_{e'}(i,t) + \ddot{R}_{-1}(i,t) = 0~, \qquad \text{i.e.,} \quad \ddot{R}_{-1}(i,t) = -\sum_{e' \neq -1} \ddot{R}_{e'}(i,t)~.
	\]
	This is an exact linear identity among the demeaned indicators. In the auxiliary regression of $R_{-1}$ on $\{R_{e'}\}_{e' \neq -1}$ and fixed effects, the FWL residuals satisfy $\ddot{R}_{-1} = -\sum_{e' \neq -1} \ddot{R}_{e'}$ exactly, so the multiple regression coefficients are $\beta_{e'} = -1$ for every $e' \neq -1$. In particular, the coefficient on $\ddot{R}_e$ is $-1$, giving $\sum_g \omega_{g,-1}^{e} = -1$.
	
	{Property~(iv), never-treated receive zero weight.} For $g = \infty$, $R_{\infty,\ell}(i,t) = 0$ for all $(i,t,\ell)$ by convention (never-treated units have no event-time). Hence $\omega_{\infty,\ell}^{e} = 0$.
\end{proof}

\Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights} is the DDD analog of \citeauthor{sun_estimating_2021}'s (\citeyear{sun_estimating_2021}) Proposition~1. The weight properties carry the same interpretation. The own-period weights (i) sum to one, so $\mu_e$ is a weighted average of the ``own'' terms---but the individual weights $\omega_{g,e}^{e}$ need not be non-negative, so this average may lie outside the convex hull of the individual terms. The other-included weights (ii) sum to zero for each event-time $\ell \neq e$, $\ell \neq -1$, so under homogeneity across cohorts at a given $\ell$ the contamination from included periods cancels. The excluded-period weights (iii) sum to $-1$, reflecting the normalization at $e = -1$. The key DDD-specific feature is that the auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:aux_regression} includes group-by-time fixed effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$, so the FWL residual of $R_e$ removes not just unit and time means but also the group-level treatment rate at each period---an additional demeaning step absent from the standard DiD setting.

I now progressively add identifying assumptions to obtain the decomposition in terms of causal parameters.

\begin{prop}[Under DDD-PCT only]\label{prop:3wfe_es_pt}
	Under {\Cref{as:dddpct}}, the population regression coefficient $\mu_e$ is a linear combination of $\CATT(g,\ell)$ with the same weights as in Proposition~{\ref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}}
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:contamination}
		\mu_e = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\ell \neq -1} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e} \CATT(g,\ell)~.
	\end{equation}
\end{prop}

Two things of note: first, $\mu_e$ receives nonzero weight on $\CATT(g,\ell)$ for $\ell \neq e$---treatment effects from other event-times contaminate the coefficient nominally associated with event-time $e$; second, the own-period weights $\omega_{g,e}^{e}$ may be negative, so the coefficient may lie outside the convex hull of the cohort-specific $\CATT(g,e)$ values.

\begin{proof}
	Fix a cohort $g \in \calGtrg$ and event-time $\ell \neq -1$. The $(g,\ell)$ term in \Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights} involves the difference
	\[
	\E[\Yit - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)]~.
	\]
	By consistency, $Y_{i,g+\ell} = Y_{i,g+\ell}(g)$ for units with $S_i = g$, so I add and subtract $\E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1]$ to obtain
	\begin{align*}
		&\E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(g) - Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) \mid g,1] \\
		&\quad + \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid g,1] - \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)]~.
	\end{align*}
	The first line is $\CATT(g,\ell)$ by definition. The second line is the difference between the $(g,1)$-conditional and unconditional untreated trends. I now show this difference vanishes under DDD-PCT, following the argument in the proof of \Cref{thm:identification}. Write the unconditional expectation as a population-weighted average over all $(s,q)$ cells
	\[
	\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)] = \sum_{s \in \calS}\sum_{q \in \{0,1\}} p_{s,q}  \E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid s,q]~,
	\]
	where $p_{s,q} = \Prob(S_i = s,  Q_i = q)$. Under DDD-PCT (\Cref{as:dddpct}), the eligible--ineligible differential in untreated trends is the same for all groups $s$ at every time $t$
	\[
	\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid s,1] - \E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty) \mid s,0] = \Lambda(t) \quad \text{for all } s~,
	\]
	where $\Lambda(t)$ is a common function of time alone. Substituting $\E[\cdot \mid s,1] = \E[\cdot \mid s,0] + \Lambda(t)$ into the population-weighted average and simplifying, the unconditional trend becomes
	\[
	\E[Y_{i,t}(\infty) - Y_{i,0}(\infty)] = \sum_{s,q} p_{s,q} \E[\cdot \mid s,0] + \Prob(Q_i = 1) \Lambda(t)~.
	\]
	In particular, the $(g,1)$-conditional trend is $\E[\cdot \mid g,0] + \Lambda(t)$. The difference between this and the unconditional trend depends only on the deviation of group $g$'s ineligible trend from the population average---precisely the component absorbed by the group-by-time fixed effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$ in the three-way demeaning of \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy}. After partialling out these fixed effects, the residual of each $(g,\ell)$ term reduces to $\CATT(g,\ell)$. Summing over all $(g,\ell)$ with weights $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ gives \eqref{eq:contamination}.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}[Under DDD-PCT and no anticipation]\label{prop:3wfe_es_noanticip}
	Under {\Cref{as:dddpct}} and~{\Cref{as:noanticipation}}, the population coefficient $\mu_e$ satisfies
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_noanticip}
		\mu_e = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg}\sum_{\substack{\ell \geq 0}} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e} \CATT(g,\ell)~.
	\end{equation}
	Pre-treatment $\CATT(g,\ell) = 0$ for $\ell < 0$ drop out. However, for pre-treatment event-times $e < 0$, $\mu_e$ is generally nonzero because it depends on post-treatment $\CATT(g,\ell)$ for $\ell \geq 0$ through the excluded-period weight property {(iii)} of Proposition~{\ref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}}.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	I partition the sum in \eqref{eq:contamination} into three groups according to the sign of $\ell$.
	
	{Pre-treatment event-times ($\ell < 0$, $\ell \neq -1$).} Under no anticipation (\Cref{as:noanticipation}), $Y_{i,g+\ell}(g) = Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty)$ for all $\ell < 0$, so $\CATT(g,\ell) = \E[Y_{i,g+\ell}(g) - Y_{i,g+\ell}(\infty) \mid g,1] = 0$. Each term $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e} \CATT(g,\ell) = 0$, and the entire pre-treatment group vanishes from the sum.
	
	{Excluded period ($\ell = -1$).} Under no anticipation, $\CATT(g,-1) = 0$ for all $g$. Although weight property~(iii) gives $\sum_g \omega_{g,-1}^{e} = -1$, the product $\omega_{g,-1}^{e} \CATT(g,-1) = 0$ for every $g$, so the excluded-period group also vanishes.
	
	{Post-treatment event-times ($\ell \geq 0$).} These are the only surviving terms, yielding \eqref{eq:3wfe_noanticip}.
	
	{Generic nonzero-ness for $e < 0$.} I now argue that $\mu_e \neq 0$ generically when $e < 0$, even though \eqref{eq:3wfe_noanticip} only sums over $\ell \geq 0$. The weight properties of \Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights} constrain the aggregate weights $\overline{\omega}_\ell^{e} = \sum_g \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ as follows. Property~(i) gives $\overline{\omega}_e^{e} = 1$, but for $e < 0$ the own-period term $\overline{\omega}_e^{e} \CATT(g,e) = 0$ under no anticipation. Property~(iii) gives $\overline{\omega}_{-1}^{e} = -1$, but the excluded-period term $\overline{\omega}_{-1}^{e} \CATT(g,-1) = 0$ under no anticipation. Property~(ii) gives $\overline{\omega}_\ell^{e} = 0$ for other included pre-treatment $\ell < 0$, $\ell \neq e$. However, the post-treatment weights $\omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ for $\ell \geq 0$ are not constrained to sum to zero across $g$. The Frisch--Waugh--Lovell residual of the pre-treatment indicator $R_e(i,t)$ (after removing $\alpha_i$, $\gamma_t$, $\delta_{S_i,t}$) retains nonzero correlation with post-treatment cohort-specific indicators $R_{g,\ell}(i,t)$ for $\ell \geq 0$, because the composition of event-times across cohorts varies with time under staggered adoption. Therefore $\sum_{g} \sum_{\ell \geq 0} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}  \CATT(g,\ell) \neq 0$ generically.
\end{proof}

\Cref{prop:3wfe_es_noanticip} has a striking implication. Even under the maintained identifying assumptions of this paper (DDD-PCT and no anticipation), the pre-period coefficients $\mu_e$ for $e < 0$ from the 3WFE event-study regression \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy} are contaminated by post-treatment effects. A researcher who finds $\widehat{\mu}_e \neq 0$ for $e < 0$ may incorrectly conclude that the DDD PCT assumption is violated, when in fact the pre-period coefficient reflects heterogeneous post-treatment effects bleeding through the implicit weights. Conversely, $\widehat{\mu}_e = 0$ for $e < 0$ does not validate DDD-PCT, since the contaminating effects may happen to cancel. I return to this point in the subsection on pretrend testing below.

\begin{prop}[Under DDD-PCT and treatment effect homogeneity]\label{prop:3wfe_es_homo}
	Under {\Cref{as:dddpct}} and the restriction that $\CATT(g,\ell) = \ATT_\ell$ for all $g$ {(}treatment effects depend on exposure duration but not on the cohort{)}, the population coefficient $\mu_e$ simplifies to
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_homo}
		\mu_e = \sum_{\ell \neq -1} \overline{\omega}_\ell^{e}  \ATT_\ell~, \qquad \overline{\omega}_\ell^{e} \equiv \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}~.
	\end{equation}
	By the weight properties of Proposition~{\ref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}}, $\overline{\omega}_e^{e} = 1$, $\overline{\omega}_{\ell}^{e} = 0$ for $\ell \neq e$, $\ell \neq -1$, and $\overline{\omega}_{-1}^{e} = -1$. Therefore
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:3wfe_homo_simplified}
		\mu_e = \ATT_e - \ATT_{-1}~.
	\end{equation}
	Under the additional restriction of no anticipation {(}$\ATT_{-1} = 0${)}, $\mu_e = \ATT_e$---the 3WFE event-study specification recovers the homogeneous event-time treatment effect.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	Starting from \eqref{eq:contamination}, impose homogeneity $\CATT(g,\ell) = \ATT_\ell$ for all $g \in \calGtrg$. Since $\ATT_\ell$ does not depend on $g$, it factors out of the inner sum over cohorts
	\[
	\mu_e = \sum_{\ell \neq -1} \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}  \ATT_\ell = \sum_{\ell \neq -1} \ATT_\ell \left(\sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}\right) = \sum_{\ell \neq -1} \overline{\omega}_\ell^{e}  \ATT_\ell~,
	\]
	which establishes \eqref{eq:3wfe_homo}. I now evaluate each aggregate weight $\overline{\omega}_\ell^{e}$ using the weight properties of \Cref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}.
	
	{Own period ($\ell = e$).} Property~(i) gives $\overline{\omega}_e^{e} = \sum_g \omega_{g,e}^{e} = 1$, so the own-period term contributes $1 \ATT_e = \ATT_e$.
	
	{Other included periods ($\ell \neq e$, $\ell \neq -1$).} Property~(ii) gives $\overline{\omega}_\ell^{e} = \sum_g \omega_{g,\ell}^{e} = 0$ for each such $\ell$, so every other-period term vanishes.
	
	{Excluded period ($\ell = -1$).} Property~(iii) gives $\overline{\omega}_{-1}^{e} = \sum_g \omega_{g,-1}^{e} = -1$, so the excluded-period term contributes $(-1) \ATT_{-1}$.
	
	Collecting the surviving terms yields $\mu_e = \ATT_e + (-1) \ATT_{-1} = \ATT_e - \ATT_{-1}$, which is \eqref{eq:3wfe_homo_simplified}. Under the additional restriction of no anticipation (\Cref{as:noanticipation}), $\ATT_{-1} = \CATT(g,-1) = 0$ for all $g$, and since all cohorts share this common zero value under homogeneity, $\ATT_{-1} = 0$. Therefore $\mu_e = \ATT_e$.
\end{proof}

\Cref{prop:3wfe_es_homo} clarifies the conditions under which the 3WFE event-study regression is valid. The specification \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy} recovers interpretable causal parameters only under the joint restrictions of DDD-PCT, treatment effect homogeneity across cohorts, and no anticipation. In practice, these conditions are rarely satisfied simultaneously. The decomposition in Propositions \ref{prop:3wfe_es_weights}--\ref{prop:3wfe_es_homo} provides a precise diagnosis of what goes wrong when each condition fails, and the stacked DDD estimator of Definition \ref{def:ddd_estimator_catt} provides a constructive solution.

The aggregate weight $\overline{\omega}_\ell^{e} = \sum_g \omega_{g,\ell}^{e}$ in \Cref{prop:3wfe_es_homo} is the population regression coefficient from regressing $R_\ell(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = \ell\} Q_i$ on the event-time indicators and fixed effects in \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy}. This follows from summing the auxiliary regression \eqref{eq:aux_regression} over $g$ at fixed $\ell$. The aggregate weight is a function of the distribution of treatment cohorts and can be estimated from the sample analog of this regression.


\subsubsection*{Intuition for contamination.}

Propositions \ref{prop:3wfe_es_pt}--\ref{prop:3wfe_es_noanticip} demonstrate that even under the identifying assumptions of this paper, the 3WFE event-study coefficient $\mu_e$ is contaminated by treatment effects from other periods and other cohorts. I now provide intuition for why this contamination occurs, adapting the omitted variable bias (OVB) argument of \citet{sun_estimating_2021} to the DDD setting.

Under DDD-PCT, the saturated DDD regression has cohort-specific event-time indicators $R_{g,\ell}(i,t) = \one\{S_i = g, Q_i = 1, t = g+\ell\}$ with coefficients $\CATT(g,\ell)$. The 3WFE event-study specification \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy} pools these cohort-specific indicators into aggregate event-time indicators $R_e(i,t) = \one\{t - S_i = e\} Q_i$. This pooling omits the cohort-specific detail. The OVB formula decomposes the pooled coefficient as $\mu_e = \sum_{g,\ell'} \omega_{g,\ell'}^{e}  \CATT(g,\ell')$, where the weight $\omega_{g,\ell'}^{e}$ is the auxiliary regression coefficient from \eqref{eq:aux_regression}. The contamination arises because the auxiliary regression has $\omega_{g,\ell'}^{e} \neq 0$ for $\ell' \neq e$---the aggregate indicator $R_e$ is correlated with cohort-specific indicators at other event-times, even after partialling out the fixed effects.

Why are these residual correlations nonzero? In an event study with staggered adoption, the panel is never balanced in both time and time relative to treatment onset. If cohort $g = 2013$ adopts treatment in 2013, then in calendar year 2015 this cohort is at event-time $\ell = 2$, while cohort $g = 2015$ is at event-time $\ell = 0$. The event-time indicator $R_0(i, 2015)$ lights up for cohort 2015 but not for cohort 2013; conversely, $R_2(i, 2015)$ lights up for cohort 2013 but not 2015. After removing unit and time fixed effects, these indicators retain residual correlation because the relative-time composition of the sample changes across time. The group-by-time fixed effects $\delta_{S_i,t}$ absorb some of this variation but do not eliminate it, since the within-group composition between eligible and ineligible units is not collinear with the group-by-time effects.

To illustrate concretely, consider a balanced panel with $T = 3$ periods, two treatment cohorts $S_i \in \{1, 2\}$, and no never-treated units ($Q_i \in \{0,1\}$). The fully dynamic specification includes $e \in \{-2, 0\}$ and excludes $e = -1$ (the normalization period). Under DDD-PCT and no anticipation, the pre-period coefficient decomposes as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:contam_example}
	\mu_{-2} = \underbracket{\CATT(2,-2)}_{\text{own period}} + \underbracket{\frac{1}{2}\CATT(1,0) - \frac{1}{2}\CATT(2,0)}_{\text{included, } \ell = 0} + \underbracket{\frac{1}{2}\CATT(1,1)}_{\text{excluded, } \ell = 1}~,
\end{equation}
where I have already set $\CATT(g,\ell) = 0$ for $\ell < 0$ (no anticipation). Even though the pre-treatment effect $\CATT(2,-2) = 0$, the coefficient $\mu_{-2}$ equals $\frac{1}{2}(\CATT(1,0) - \CATT(2,0)) + \frac{1}{2}\CATT(1,1)$, which is nonzero whenever effects are heterogeneous across cohorts ($\CATT(1,0) \neq \CATT(2,0)$) or there are lagged effects ($\CATT(1,1) \neq 0$).

In the DDD setting, a third source of contamination is present beyond the two identified by \citet{sun_estimating_2021}. The 3WFE specification \eqref{eq:3wfe_eventstudy} omits the eligibility-by-time fixed effects $\eta_{Q_i,t}$ that are structurally necessary for triple-difference identification (Section \ref{sub:missing_fe}). This means the coefficient $\mu_e$ is identified from variation that includes the eligibility-by-time channel, compounding the cross-period and cross-cohort contamination analyzed in Propositions \ref{prop:3wfe_es_pt}--\ref{prop:3wfe_es_homo} with a bias from failing to partial out eligibility-specific time trends.


\begin{proof}[Proof of \Cref{prop:3wfe_decomp}]
	I establish each source of bias in the three-way fixed effects regression
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_3wfe}
		Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i, t} + \tau D_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t},
	\end{equation}
	where $D_{i,t} = \one\{t \geq S_i\} Q_{i,t}$ (with $Q_{i,t} = Q_i$ under time-invariant eligibility).
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Part (i): Negative weights.}
	By the FWL theorem, the OLS estimator $\widehat{\tau}^{\text{3WFE}}$ equals the coefficient from the regression of $Y_{i,t}$ on $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$, where $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ is the residual from projecting $D_{i,t}$ onto the space spanned by unit fixed effects $\{\alpha_i\}$, time fixed effects $\{\gamma_t\}$, and group-by-time fixed effects $\{\delta_{S_i, t}\}$.
	
	Before deriving the FWL residual, I note two structural issues with the 3WFE specification \eqref{eq:app_3wfe}.
	
	First, the group-by-time fixed effects $\{\delta_{S_i, t}\}$ are indexed over all groups $S_i \in \calS$ and all time periods $t$. When the group dimension spans all values in $\calS$ (including the never-treated group), the column space of the group-by-time dummies {strictly contains} the column space of the global time dummies $\{\gamma_t\}$: one can recover $\gamma_t$ as any weighted average $\sum_g (n_g/n)  \delta_{g,t}$ across groups. Hence the global time fixed effects are redundant once group-by-time fixed effects are included. In practice, the software absorbs $\gamma_t$ into $\delta_{S_i,t}$, so the residualized treatment depends only on the unit and group-by-time projections.
	
	Second, and more substantively, the 3WFE specification lacks {eligibility-by-time} fixed effects $\{\eta_{Q_i, t}\}$. A proper triple-difference design requires absorbing the common eligibility-specific trend that operates across all groups---precisely the trend that the third difference is designed to remove. Without eligibility-by-time fixed effects, the model implicitly assumes that the eligible--ineligible outcome differential is time-invariant {unconditionally}, rather than allowing it to evolve freely and relying on cross-group differencing to remove it. Consequently, the 3WFE specification does not properly implement the triple-difference design. The ``forbidden comparisons'' that arise are entirely within the group-by-time dimension; no additional forbidden comparisons are generated across the eligibility dimension because the model fails to exploit that dimension at all.
	
	To see this formally, note that the fully saturated DDD regression should include unit FEs $\alpha_i$, group-by-time FEs $\delta_{S_i, t}$, {and} eligibility-by-time FEs $\eta_{Q_i, t}$:
	\[
	Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_{S_i, t} + \eta_{Q_i, t} + \tau D_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t}.
	\]
	The standard 3WFE \eqref{eq:app_3wfe} omits $\eta_{Q_i, t}$, so the treatment coefficient $\widehat{\tau}^{\text{3WFE}}$ conflates the causal effect with any time-varying eligibility premium that differs from the group-by-time trend structure. 
	
	With these caveats, I proceed with the FWL derivation of the standard 3WFE as written. Since group-by-time FEs absorb the global time FEs, the effective projection is onto unit FEs and group-by-time FEs only. The FWL residual of $D_{i,t}$ after projecting out $\{\alpha_i\}$ and $\{\delta_{S_i, t}\}$ is 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_D_resid}
		\widetilde{D}_{i,t} = D_{i,t} - \overline{D}_{i,\cdot} - \overline{D}_{S_i,t} + \overline{D}_{S_i,\cdot},
	\end{equation}
	where the averaging operators are:
	\begin{alignat*}{2}
		&\overline{D}_{i,\cdot} = \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T D_{i,t} &\qquad&\text{(unit mean)}, \\
		&\overline{D}_{S_i,t} = \frac{1}{n_{S_i}}\sum_{j:  S_j = S_i} D_{j,t} &\qquad&\text{(group-by-time mean)}, \\
		&\overline{D}_{S_i,\cdot} = \frac{1}{n_{S_i}  T}\sum_{j:  S_j = S_i}\sum_{t=1}^T D_{j,t} &\qquad&\text{(group mean)},
	\end{alignat*}
	and $n_{S_i} = |\{j : S_j = S_i\}|$ is the number of units in group $S_i$. The global time mean $\overline{D}_{\cdot,t}$ and total mean $\overline{D}_{\cdot\cdot}$ do not appear separately because they are absorbed by the group-by-time fixed effects.
	
	I now evaluate each term explicitly for a treated unit with $S_i = g$ and $Q_i = 1$.
	Since $D_{i,t} = \one\{t \geq g\} Q_i = \one\{t \geq g\}$ for such a unit:
	\begin{align*}
		D_{i,t} &= \one\{t \geq g\}, \\
		\overline{D}_{i,\cdot} &= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \one\{t \geq g\} = \frac{T - g + 1}{T}.
	\end{align*}
	The group-by-time mean for group $g$ is 
	\[
	\overline{D}_{S_i=g, t} = \frac{1}{n_g}\sum_{j:  S_j = g} D_{j,t} = p_{Q=1|S=g}  \one\{t \geq g\},
	\]
	where $p_{Q=1|S=g} = n_g^{-1}\sum_{j:  S_j = g} Q_j$ is the proportion of eligible units in group $g$, since all eligible units in group $g$ have $D_{j,t} = \one\{t \geq g\}$ and all ineligible units have $D_{j,t} = 0$.
	The group mean for group $g$ is 
	\[
	\overline{D}_{S_i=g, \cdot} = \frac{1}{n_g  T}\sum_{j:  S_j = g}\sum_{t=1}^T D_{j,t} = p_{Q=1|S=g}  \frac{T - g + 1}{T}.
	\]
	
	Substituting into \eqref{eq:app_D_resid} for a unit with $S_i = g$, $Q_i = 1$:
	\begin{align}
		\widetilde{D}_{i,t} &= \one\{t \geq g\} - \frac{T-g+1}{T} - p_{Q=1|S=g} \one\{t \geq g\} + p_{Q=1|S=g} \frac{T-g+1}{T} \notag\\
		&= (1 - p_{Q=1|S=g})\left(\one\{t \geq g\} - \frac{T-g+1}{T}\right). \label{eq:app_D_resid_explicit}
	\end{align}
	The factor $(1 - p_{Q=1|S=g})$ is the proportion of {ineligible} units in group $g$; it scales down the residual treatment variation as the share of eligible units increases. The term in parentheses, $\one\{t \geq g\} - (T-g+1)/T$, is the within-unit deviation of $D_{i,t}$ from its time average: positive for post-treatment periods ($t \geq g$) and negative for pre-treatment periods ($t < g$).
	
	Crucially, because the group-by-time FEs absorb the global time FEs, the residualized treatment $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ depends only on the {within-group} variation of $D_{i,t}$ across units (eligible vs.\ ineligible) and across time (pre vs.\ post). There is no cross-group component in $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$. The ``forbidden comparison'' bias arises because different groups $g$ contribute different within-group residuals, and the OLS estimand implicitly forms cross-group comparisons of these residuals.
	
	\begin{remark}[Missing eligibility-by-time FEs and its consequences]\label{rem:missing_elig_time}
		The absence of eligibility-by-time FEs $\eta_{Q_i, t}$ in the standard 3WFE specification means that any common time-varying eligibility premium---the trend component that DDD identification is explicitly designed to difference out---is {not} absorbed by the fixed effects. Instead, it is captured by the treatment coefficient $\widehat{\tau}^{\text{3WFE}}$ to the extent that it correlates with the treatment indicator $D_{i,t}$. This conflation is a fundamental deficiency: the 3WFE regression performs a {two-way} comparison (unit and group-by-time) rather than the {three-way} comparison required by DDD identification. Including eligibility-by-time FEs would correct this but introduces its own complications under staggered adoption, 
	\end{remark}
	
	In the staggered setting with multiple treatment cohorts, the residualized indicator $\widetilde{D}_{i,t}$ takes negative values for some $(i,t)$ pairs---specifically, for early-treated units in later time periods where the group-by-time demeaning produces a large subtraction. The OLS estimand is
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_3wfe_decomp}
		\widehat{\tau}^{\text{3WFE}} \pto \frac{\sum_{i,t} \widetilde{D}_{i,t}  \E[Y_{i,t}]}{\sum_{i,t} \widetilde{D}_{i,t}^2} = \sum_{g,t: t \geq g} w_{g,t}  \ATT(g,t),
	\end{equation}
	where the implicit weights $w_{g,t} = \sum_{i: S_i = g, Q_i = 1} \widetilde{D}_{i,t} / \sum_{i',t'} \widetilde{D}_{i',t'}^2$ can be negative. This extends the decomposition of \citet{goodman-bacon_difference--differences_2021} from DiD to the DDD setting, as in \citet{olden_triple_2022}. Negative weights arise when some $2 \times 2 \times 2$ sub-comparisons use earlier-treated cohorts as implicit controls.
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Part (ii): Covariate bias.}
	Consider the augmented 3WFE regression:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_3wfe_cov}
		Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \delta_{S_i, t} + \tau D_{i,t} + X_i'\beta + \epsilon_{i,t}.
	\end{equation}
	The coefficient $\beta$ is identified from the within-variation of $X_i$ after absorbing fixed effects. However, since $X_i$ is time-invariant, $X_i'\beta$ is collinear with $\alpha_i$ after within-unit demeaning (the FWL residual of $X_i$ on unit FEs is zero). In practice, $X_i'\beta$ is identified from across-unit variation within group-time cells, and $\widehat{\beta}$ reflects a weighted average of the covariate effects across different comparison types.
	
	Following \citet{leventer_triple_2025} and \citet{ortiz-santanna_triple_2025}, the problem arises because the 3WFE regression imposes a \textit{common} covariate coefficient $\beta$ across all DDD cells, rather than allowing the covariate adjustment to vary by cell. The DDD identification formula (\Cref{thm:identification}) requires integrating the triple difference of conditional expectations over the \textit{treated} covariate distribution. The 3WFE regression, by contrast, uses the \textit{pooled} covariate distribution across all cells and comparison types. When the covariate effect on outcome trends differs across $(S, Q)$ cells---as is typical in DDD applications where the treatment eligibility dimension interacts with covariates---the pooled adjustment introduces a bias:
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{covariate}} &= \sum_{g \in \calGtrg} \sum_{t \geq g} w_{g,t} \E\left[X_i'\left(\beta_{\mathrm{pooled}} - \beta_{g,1,t}\right)\left(D_{i,t} - p_{g,t}\right) \mid S_i \in \{g, g_c\}, t \in [g-L, g+K]\right], \label{eq:app_cov_bias}
	\end{align}
	where $\beta_{g,1,t}$ is the ``correct'' cell-specific covariate coefficient for the treated population $(S_i = g, Q_i = 1)$ at time $t$, $\beta_{\mathrm{pooled}}$ is the common covariate coefficient estimated by the 3WFE regression, $p_{g,t} = \Prob(D_{i,t} = 1 \mid S_i = g)$ is the within-group treatment probability at time $t$, and the conditioning is over the implicit pairwise sub-experiments $(g, g_c, t, t')$ embedded in the 3WFE regression via the FWL projection. The weights $w_{g,t}$ arise from the FWL decomposition and sum to one.
	
	The bias arises because the 3WFE regression constrains all cells to share a common $\beta_{\mathrm{pooled}}$. In the DDD identification formula (\Cref{thm:identification}), the covariate adjustment is cell-specific: each conditional expectation $\E[\DeltaY_{i,t} \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q, X_i = x]$ may have a different dependence on $X_i$. When the effect of $X_i$ on outcome trends differs across $(S, Q)$ cells---as is typical in DDD applications where the eligibility dimension interacts with covariates---the pooled coefficient $\beta_{\mathrm{pooled}}$ is a misspecified average, and the residual $\beta_{\mathrm{pooled}} - \beta_{g,1,t}$ is generally non-zero.
	
	The stacked DR estimator eliminates this bias by using flexible, cell-specific nuisance models $m_t^{s,q}(x)$ and propensity score weights $p_{s,q}(x)$ within each stack. The covariate adjustment is nonparametric within each cell and integrates over the treated covariate distribution, rather than imposing a common linear specification.
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Part (iii): Forbidden comparisons.}
	By the Strezhnev decomposition \citep{strezhnev_decomposing_2023}, the 3WFE estimand can be written as a weighted sum over all pairwise $2 \times 2 \times 2$ sub-experiments formed by choosing two groups $g, g'$ with $g < g'$ and comparing eligible versus ineligible units across these groups in pre- and post-treatment periods:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:app_strezhnev}
		\widehat{\tau}^{\text{3WFE}} \pto \sum_{(g, g', t, t')} \lambda_{g,g',t,t'} \mathrm{DDD}_{g,g',t,t'},
	\end{equation}
	where $\mathrm{DDD}_{g,g',t,t'}$ is the $2 \times 2 \times 2$ contrast using group $g'$ as the comparison group and times $t, t'$ as pre/post.
	
	A ``forbidden comparison'' arises when $g' < g$ and $t' \geq g'$: the comparison group $g'$ is already treated at time $t'$, so its outcome change reflects its own treatment effect rather than the untreated counterfactual. I now decompose the resulting DDD contrast explicitly. For groups $g' < g$ and post-period $t' \geq g'$, the $2 \times 2 \times 2$ contrast is 
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{DDD}_{g,g',t,t'} &= \left[\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0]\right] \notag\\
		&\qquad - \left[\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g',  Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g',  Q_i = 0]\right], \label{eq:app_forbidden_expand}
	\end{align}
	where $\DeltaY_{i,t'} = Y_{i,t'} - Y_{i,t}$ is the outcome change between the pre-period $t$ and the post-period $t'$. I decompose each component by substituting the observed outcomes in terms of potential outcomes.
	
	For the treated group ($S_i = g$, $Q_i = 1$), if $t' \geq g$ then $Y_{i,t'} = Y_{i,t'}(g)$, and the eligible DiD for group $g$ is 
	\begin{align*}
		&\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0] \\
		&= \ATT(g, t') + \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid S_i = g, Q_i = 0]\right),
	\end{align*}
	where the second term is the untreated eligibility trend difference within group $g$.
	
	For the comparison group ($S_i = g'$, $Q_i = 1$), since $t' \geq g'$, these units are {also} treated: $Y_{i,t'} = Y_{i,t'}(g')$. Therefore the eligible DiD for group $g'$ is 
	\begin{align*}
		&\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g',  Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'} \mid S_i = g',  Q_i = 0] \\
		&= \ATT(g', t') + \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid S_i = g',  Q_i = 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid S_i = g',  Q_i = 0]\right).
	\end{align*}
	
	Substituting back into \eqref{eq:app_forbidden_expand}, I have
	\begin{align}
		\mathrm{DDD}_{g,g',t,t'} &= \ATT(g, t') - \ATT(g', t') \notag\\
		&\quad + \underbracket{\left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid g, 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid g, 0]\right) - \left(\E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid g', 1] - \E[\DeltaY_{i,t'}(\infty) \mid g', 0]\right)}_{\text{DDD PCT difference}} ~, \label{eq:app_forbidden}
	\end{align}
	where I abbreviate $\E[\cdot \mid s, q]$ for $\E[\cdot \mid S_i = s, Q_i = q]$. Under \Cref{as:dddpct}, the difference vanishes, so the forbidden DDD contrast reduces to $\ATT(g, t') - \ATT(g', t')$. This is the $\ATT(g', t')$ contamination: the comparison group's outcome change at $t'$ includes its own treatment effect. Under homogeneous effects ($\ATT(g,t') = \ATT(g',t')$ for all $g, g'$), the contamination cancels. Under heterogeneous effects, it does not, producing:
	\[
	\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}} = \sum_{\substack{(g,g',t,t'):\\ g' < g, t' \geq g'}} \lambda_{g,g',t,t'}  \left(\ATT(g,t') - \ATT(g',t')\right).
	\]
	
	\medskip\noindent\textit{Summary.}
	Combining the three sources, the 3WFE probability limit is
	\[
	\widehat{\tau}^{\text{3WFE}} \pto \sum_{g,t} w_{g,t}  \ATT(g,t) + \mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{covariate}} + \mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}},
	\]
	where some $w_{g,t} < 0$, $\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{covariate}} \neq 0$ when covariate effects are cell-specific, and $\mathrm{Bias}_{\mathrm{forbidden}} \neq 0$ when treatment effects are heterogeneous across cohorts. The stacked DR estimator avoids all three: it uses researcher-chosen non-negative weights, flexible cell-specific covariate adjustment, and clean comparison groups by construction.
\end{proof}




\section{Proof of Validity of CRVE in Stacked OLS Regressions} \label{app:proof-CRVE-validity}

I provide a justification of the use of cluster-robust standard errors (CRVE), clustered at the original unit level, in the stacked event-study OLS regression. I establish that the CRVE is a consistent estimator of the asymptotic variance of the stacked estimator under the sampling and moment conditions established in the main text. Specifically, I maintain \Cref{as:sampling}, \Cref{as:shares}, and \Cref{as:moments4} throughout this section. As before, the number of units in each stack $g$ is denoted $n_g$, and the number of units in each $(s,q)$ cell within that stack is denoted $n_{s,q,g}$, and $n_g/n \to \lambda_g > 0$ and $n_{s,q,g}/n_g \to \pi_{s,q,g} > 0$ under \Cref{as:shares}.

% \subsection*{Estimation Error and Score Representation}
The stacked event-study coefficient $\widehat{\tau}_e$ is obtained by estimating a fully saturated ordinary least squares regression on the pooled stacked dataset. By Frisch-Waugh-Lovell, the multivariate regression can be analytically reduced to a bivariate regression of the outcome on the residualized treatment indicator. Let $\widetilde{R}_{i,g} = \widetilde{R}_e(i, g+e, g)$ denote the FWL residual of the treatment indicator for unit $i$ in stack $g$ at event-time $e$, obtained after projecting out the stack-by-group-by-time and stack-by-eligibility-by-time fixed effects. Because these fixed effects are mutually orthogonal across stacks and times, the residual $\widetilde{R}_{i,g}$ is strictly zero for all periods other than $t = g+e$ and for all stacks other than $g$. The estimated coefficient $\widehat{\tau}_e$ can therefore be written exactly as
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\tau}_e = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g} Y_{i,g+e}}{\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g}^2} ~.
\end{equation}
The population analogue of this coefficient, $\tau_e$, is defined by replacing the sample sums with their population expectations. The estimation error of the stacked estimator can be isolated by substituting the outcome $Y_{i,g+e}$ with the sum of its conditional expectation and the regression error. The OLS residual for unit $i$ in stack $g$ is defined as $\widehat{\varepsilon}_{i,g+e,g} = Y_{i,g+e} - \widehat{Y}_{i,g+e,g}$, where $\widehat{Y}_{i,g+e,g}$ is the OLS fitted value. Let $\widehat{s}_i(e)$ denote the unit-level estimated score, which aggregates the product of the residualized treatment indicator and the regression error across all stacks in which unit $i$ appears:
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{s}_i(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g} \widehat{\varepsilon}_{i,g+e,g} ~.
\end{equation}
Multiplying by $\sqrt{n}$ to study the asymptotic distribution, the scaled estimation error takes the form
\begin{equation} \label{eq:app_est_error}
	\sqrt{n}(\widehat{\tau}_e - \tau_e) = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g}^2 \right)^{-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{s}_i(e) ~.
\end{equation}
This representation mirrors the standard generalized method of moments (GMM) framework, where the first term represents the inverse of the sample Hessian matrix (the ``bread'') and the second term is the scaled sample average of the score vector (the ``meat'').

% \subsection*{Asymptotic Validity}
The CRVE for the variance of $\widehat{\tau}_e$, clustered at the level of the original unit $i$, is constructed using the empirical sandwich formula
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{\Var}(\widehat{\tau}_e) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g}^2 \right)^{-2} \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{s}_i(e)^2 ~.
\end{equation}
To prove that this estimator provides valid inference, I must establish that $n\widehat{\Var}(\widehat{\tau}_e)$ converges in probability to the true asymptotic variance of the scaled estimation error in \eqref{eq:app_est_error}. The convergence of the bread is immediate. By the WLLN, the scaled denominator $n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g}^2$ converges in probability to its population expectation $V = \E[\sum_g \widetilde{R}_{i,g}^2]$. The critical step is to demonstrate that the scaled meat of the sandwich, given by $n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{s}_i(e)^2$, converges to the population variance of the score, defined as $\Omega = \E[(s_i^*(e))^2]$. The population score for unit $i$ is $s_i^*(e) = \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g} \varepsilon_{i,g+e,g}$, where $\varepsilon_{i,g+e,g} = Y_{i,g+e} - \E[Y_{i,g+e} \mid S_i, Q_i]$ is the true conditional error term.

I first characterize the rate of convergence of the estimated regression residuals to the population errors. Because the stacked event-study regression is fully saturated by the inclusion of stack-by-group-by-time and stack-by-eligibility-by-time fixed effects, the OLS fitted value for any observation is exactly the sample mean of the outcome within that specific stack-cell-time partition. Specifically, for a unit $i$ belonging to cell $(s,q)$ within stack $g$, the fitted value is $\widehat{Y}_{i,g+e,g} = \overline{Y}_{s,q,g+e,g}$. The OLS residual can therefore be algebraically decomposed as $\widehat{\varepsilon}_{i,g+e,g} = \varepsilon_{i,g+e,g} - \delta_{s,q,g}$, where $\delta_{s,q,g} = \overline{Y}_{s,q,g+e,g} - \E[Y_{i,g+e} \mid S_i=s, Q_i=q]$ captures the estimation error of the cell mean. By the CLT and \Cref{as:shares}, the sample mean of i.i.d.\ outcomes converges to its population expectation at a $\sqrt{n}$ rate, implying that $\delta_{s,q,g} = O_p(n^{-1/2})$. The unit-level estimated score can then be rewritten as the population score minus an estimation error term
\begin{equation}
	\widehat{s}_i(e) = s_i^*(e) - \Delta_i,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_i \equiv \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g} \delta_{s(i), q(i), g}$. Since $\widetilde{R}_{i,g}$ is bounded and $\delta_{s,q,g} = O_p(n^{-1/2})$, it follows that the aggregate unit-level discrepancy is also $\Delta_i = O_p(n^{-1/2})$.

I next analyze the convergence of the empirical score variance by expanding the scaled meat of the sandwich estimator. Expanding the square of the estimated score yields three distinct components:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:meat_decomp}
	\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{s}_i(e)^2 = \underbracket{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (s_i^*(e))^2}_{(i)} - \underbracket{\frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n s_i^*(e) \Delta_i}_{(ii)} + \underbracket{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i^2}_{(iii)} ~.
\end{equation}
I evaluate each of these three terms in turn. The first term (i) is the sample average of the squared population score. Under the finite fourth moments condition stated in \Cref{as:moments4}, the squared score has a finite variance, allowing the application of the WLLN to conclude that $n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (s_i^*(e))^2 \pto \E[(s_i^*(e))^2] = \Omega$. 

The third term (iii) represents the average of the squared discrepancies. Because $\Delta_i = O_p(n^{-1/2})$ for all units, its square is $\Delta_i^2 = O_p(n^{-1})$. The sample average of these squared terms, $n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \Delta_i^2$, is bounded by the maximum over the finite number of cells of $O_p(n^{-1})$. Consequently, this term vanishes asymptotically, satisfying $O_p(n^{-1}) = o_p(1)$.

The second term (ii) is the cross-product between the population score and the estimation error. Substituting the definition of $\Delta_i$, this term can be rearranged by exchanging the summations over units and stacks
\begin{equation}
	\frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n s_i^*(e) \Delta_i = 2 \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \sum_{(s,q)} \delta_{s,q,g} \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i \in \text{cell } (s,q,g)} s_i^*(e) \widetilde{R}_{i,g} \right) ~.
\end{equation}
Within each cell partition $(s,q,g)$, the expression in the parentheses is the sample average of the product $s_i^*(e) \widetilde{R}_{i,g}$. The population expectation of this product conditional on the cell is exactly zero, because $\E[s_i^*(e) \mid S_i=s, Q_i=q] = 0$ by the definition of the true error term $\varepsilon_{i,g+e,g}$, and $\widetilde{R}_{i,g}$ is a constant within the cell. By the CLT, the sample average of a zero-mean random variable scaled by $n$ is bounded in probability by $O_p(n^{-1/2})$. The cross-term is therefore the product of a finite number of components, each of which multiplies $\delta_{s,q,g} = O_p(n^{-1/2})$ by an average that is $O_p(n^{-1/2})$. The resulting product is $O_p(n^{-1})$, which implies that the entire cross-term converges in probability to zero, or $o_p(1)$.

Combining these three limits establishes that the empirical variance of the estimated score converges to the true variance of the population score, $n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{s}_i(e)^2 \pto \Omega$. Finally, applying Slutsky's theorem to the full CRVE sandwich estimator demonstrates that the scaled variance converges to the exact asymptotic variance of the OLS estimator
\begin{equation}
	n \widehat{\Var}(\widehat{\tau}_e) = \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{g \in \calGtrg(e)} \widetilde{R}_{i,g}^2 \right)^{-2} \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \widehat{s}_i(e)^2 \right) \pto V^{-2} \Omega ~.
\end{equation}
This rigorously justifies the use of cluster-robust standard errors. By calculating the score at the level of the original unit $i$ and implicitly summing the score components across all stacks in which the unit appears before squaring, the CRVE automatically and correctly accounts for the cross-stack dependence induced by the reuse of comparison units.


\section{Auxiliary Results} \label{app:auxiliary}

\begin{lemma}[Lindeberg Condition for Bounded Influence Functions]\label{lem:lindeberg}
	If $\{W_i\}_{i=1}^n$ are i.i.d.\ with $\psi_i = \psi(W_i)$ satisfying $\E[\psi_i] = 0$ and $\sigma^2 = \E[\psi_i^2] \in (0, \infty)$, then the Lindeberg condition holds:
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:lem_lindeberg}
		\forall  \varepsilon > 0, \qquad \frac{1}{\sigma^2 n}\sum_{i=1}^n \E\left[\psi_i^2  \one\{|\psi_i| > \varepsilon  \sigma\sqrt{n}\}\right] \to 0.
	\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	Since $\{W_i\}$ are i.i.d., every summand is identical, so
	\[
	\frac{1}{\sigma^2 n}\sum_{i=1}^n \E\left[\psi_i^2  \one\{|\psi_i| > \varepsilon\sigma\sqrt{n}\}\right] = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}  \E\left[\psi_1^2  \one\{|\psi_1| > \varepsilon\sigma\sqrt{n}\}\right]~.
	\]
	As $n \to \infty$, $\varepsilon\sigma\sqrt{n} \to \infty$, so $\one\{|\psi_1| > \varepsilon\sigma\sqrt{n}\} \to 0$ almost surely (since $|\psi_1| < \infty$ a.s.). The integrand $\psi_1^2  \one\{|\psi_1| > \varepsilon\sigma\sqrt{n}\} \leq \psi_1^2$ is dominated by the integrable function $\psi_1^2$ (since $\E[\psi_1^2] = \sigma^2 < \infty$). By the dominated convergence theorem, $\E[\psi_1^2  \one\{|\psi_1| > \varepsilon\sigma\sqrt{n}\}] \to 0$.
\end{proof}
